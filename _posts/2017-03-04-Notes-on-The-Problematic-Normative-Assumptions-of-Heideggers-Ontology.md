Heidegger neglects feminist concerns when treating certain topics (bodies, others, temporality and history). His philosophy is also formulated so as to render such concerns irrelevant.

Heidegger's philosophy exhibits a systematic blindness to gender and other normative assumption.

Heidegger rules out in advance any serius consideration of significant differences between individuals. This characteristic of his methodology leads him to post a culturally specific version of Dasein that he makes exemplary in any uncritical way.

## Bodies

Somatophobia. The patriarchal denial of the significance of the body.

By speaking of Dasein Heidegger aims at 1) severing any ontological continuity between the way Dasein exists and the way other other objects exist, and 2) establish that Dasein's way of being includes an understanding of the world. Dasein's way of being is constituted to some extent by its understanding of other entities and their relation to its onw being.

"As there-being, Dasein is always already engaged in the world, and not set over against it, not in ontological oppostion to it." (p. 76).

The self is not a thing that thinks but a way of being.

>Dasein exists as its possibilities, both at the ontical and ontological levels, both as situated in relation to the definite, concrete possibilities that define its existence as an entity and as situated in relation to its fundamental existential possibilities that constitute the possible ways for it to be. (p. 77)

In order to overcome the treatment of the being of Dasein and the being of objects as present-to-hand Heidegger "undertakes an analysis of the equipmental relations that structure Dasein's dealings with the world."

Ordinary activities such as hammering have significance within the overall projects Dasein undertakes: "the end to which it is directed, the meaning and purpose of this project, and its relationsip to Dasein and to other who are affected by, and who contribute to, Dasein's projects."

The world of equipment "evokes a network of significations, alliances, priorities, and so on, the totality of which make up Dasein's self-understanding."

Equipment refers to a plurality of references rather than to a single object.

Dasein first understands its own being at the level of the ready-to-hand.

Dasein's way of being includes within it an understanding of its way of being. This involves a working understanding of other beings.

In the traditional view:
> all entities exhibit the same mode of presence, and that mode of presence is essentially characteristic of a metaphyscis that models its conception of reality on substance. Thus inert physcial matter, or objects as defined by their spatiotemporal location, come to represent the prevailing idea of what constitutes reality.

The task in Heidegger's view is
> to provide an account of the relational way in which Dasein exists in the world. ... Dasein is integrated into the world, rather than separated off from it.

"Heidegger's account of Dasein remains more consonant with the disembodied transcendental subject that Heidegger claims Kant inherited from Descartes than Heidegger admits. The explanation for this, in my view, lies in the dominant role that understanding plays in Heidegger's analysis of Dasein, the extent to which he appeals to the necessity of formulating a concept of the understanding, and the lack of any sustained account of bodily experience"

B&T is abotu the progressive clarifying and deepenng of Dasein's self-understanding. 1) Dasein has being as an issue for itself, 2) understanding is interpreted under the rubric of possibility, 3) as projection.

No matter how far Heidegger imagines having depared from teh Cartesian notion of the subject as a thinking being or the medieval notion of the subject whereby intellect determines or takes the measure of the thing through adequation, the legacy of a disincarnate intellect remains. His ontological project remains bound to theoretical clarification.

In B&T there is a progressive move away from the concrete starting point of Dasein's world and toward a disembodied understanding of Dasein.

The ontological structures of the preontological experience are _existentialia_, the fundamental or basic structures of Dasein's existence.

Heidegger's account of the relationship with the world is geared almost exclusively around work, i.e. task oriented. Not sexuality, eroticism, enjoyment, or pleasure.

In making spatiality derivative of temporality Heidegger treats spatiality only in the very limited context of the ready-to-hand relations that constitute circumspective concern.
