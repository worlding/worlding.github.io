Ash Sarkar:

>... you talked about 'is it natural that you care more about the woman on our street than the woman that lives in the Congo?' For some of us we have family that live in the Congo and on our street. The border is not a measure of distance. The border assigns who lives and who dies. It's not cognitive distance, it's not geopolitical distance even. We have a model for transnational identities that already exist in this country that people feel strongly about, and that's the presence of people of colour."
