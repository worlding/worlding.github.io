* In the years 1565-76 the Tudors established English colonies in the Gaelic areas of Ireland. 576
* Earlier attempts to establish plantations had been for the purpose of defending the Pale -- the area around Dublin loyal to the English crown -- from Gaelic Irish attacks. In 1565 the decision was made to bring all of Ireland under English control. 576
* The venture ended in failure, however many of the aristocrats involved would afterwards become involved in ventures in the 'New World' as well as in later Irish plantation efforts.

## On Establishing Legal title
* The English Crown had established titled to most of Ireland by right of conquest during the Norman invasion of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. 579
* The native Irish reoccupied much of the land in the fourteenth and fifteenth centures. 579
* By English legal reasoning the reoccupiers could be classed as trespassers. 579

## On the treatment of the natives
* The Norman invasion had only driven off the ruling elite of the territory conquored. The majoritiy of the original inhabitants remained as tenants and cultivators. The decendents of the Norman rulers became the 'Old English'
* The Old English saw the struggle in Ireland as a conflict between Gaelic and English cultures. While they viewed the Gaelic system to be barbarous they also considered those who lived under it to be capable of becoming civilised subjects of under English law.
* The Essex experience experience "convinced the queen and her advisors that the Irish were an unreasonable people and that they ... might be slaughtered by extralegal methods."
* Attocities were committed in Ulster and Munster, including the systematic execution of noncombatants. This was unlike the practices used in the Tudor rebellions in England. was justified on the grounds of both the behaviour of the natives and as an efficient means of ending the war: "through the terrour which the people conceived thereby it made short warres." 582
* Canny's question: how had the Irish come to be regarded as uncivilized?

* The fact that the Irish were Christian was never doubted by the Normans, "but it was always recognised that Christianity in Gaelic Ireland did not fully conform to Roman liturgical practice, and that many pre-Christian traditions and customs were only slightly veneered by Christianity."
* The English involved in the sixteenth-century invasions were for the most part extreme Protestants. They branded the Gaelic Irish as pagan.

* The English recognised a distinction between Christianity and civilisation. They believed a people could be civilised without being made Christian but not chirstianised with first being made civil.
* To admit that the native Irish were Christian would have been to acknowledge them as civilised.
* By declaring the Irish to be pagan the English were decreeing that hey were culpable sience their heathenism was owing not to a loack of opportunity but rather to the fact that their system of government was antithetical to Christianity. 586

* Many of the colonisers came to Ireland with a preconception of what a barbaric society was like, and they found features in Gaelic life to fit this model.

* "The colonizers were assisting in the development of a concept of historical process and cultural development, as the widening of the horizons of the articulate citizen of sixteenth-century England, both intellectually and geographically, slowly eroded the old idea of a static world." 592
