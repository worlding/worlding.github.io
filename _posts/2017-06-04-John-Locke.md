## State of nature
* Locke saw his idea of nature existing in an historical sense. He conceived of native Americans as examples of natural men and uses them to draw conclusions about conditions in the state of nature
* The learned men of 17th century England were fascinated with the "New World".
* Locke used accounts of the new world in his library to provide concrete evidence of the character of 'natural man'.
* Locke chose only those aspects of native American life which fit his theory.
* Locke's perception of the new wold derived from travelogues (volumes written by European explorers to the new world), his secretarial work to the Lord Prprietors of Carolina, and the Council of trade, and as a Comissioner on the Bord of Trade
* "Natural men were percieved either as innocents still existing in a garden of Eden, or followers of the devil. This seeming contradiction in the moral worth of 'natural' man can only be understood in relation to the view such thinkers took of civilisaiton"
* The 'savage' described in travelogues grew more ignoble as conflicts grew between the natives and European settlers.
* Locke used the description in the travelogues to create a reason for entering civil society and an alternative preferable to tyranny (ignoble tendency towards war, noble living peaceably together).
* The idea of the noble savage can be traced in the Christian tradition to the ideal of Adam in the Garden of Eden. Description of Amerindians would suggest that they were not making good use of the resources available. "For all their virtues, they had failed to use what nature provided" p.45
* "The transformation of natural man from the peaceful and free nomad to the vicious savage within the state of war is as inevitable as the fall of Adam from the Grace of God"
* Ignoble savage: violent in nature, without discipline or industry, incivilised in his personal habits and a worshipper of the devil.
* Natural man is ignoble to the extent that he is inferior to men in civil society.
* "Lock adopts the ignoble savage written about in many of his travelogues in his discussion of the degeneratioin of the state of nature into the state of war."
* For Lock natural man is inferior to Englishmen primarily because his reason has not yet devloped to the same extent. Similar to gap between children and adults
* "It was often argued that force would be unnecessary because once the superiority of a Christian life had been demonstrated to the natives, they would, by virtue of their own untapped reason, inevitably convert."
* "Like many of the explorers, Locke believes that Christianity will spread throughout the world by virtue of the growth in natural man's reason."
* "Locke, like these explorers, assumed that natural man would, by virtue of his own reason, join civil society."
* "Locke's state of nature proceeds through a series of stages. Beginning with nomadic life, natural man gradually developed a private system of cultivation which leads to the use of money, conflict and inequalities and the need for civil government."
* Locke misrepresents many of the accounts of Natives, including regarding political development, state of war (always group not individual), and labour (settlers relied on Native agriculture).
* Why did Locke misrepresent Native use of the land? "First, it is crucial to Locke's whole arguemen tabout propoerty that labour and industry develop in tangent with civil society, being in all ways superior to the natural state and closer to God. Secondly, the notion that native Americans did not properly use God's gifts, as Europeans did, was a common belief amongst those English involved in settling the new world."
* Rationale: Locke's objective in the Second Treatise was to articulate the ends of civil i.e. European government. For Locke the most important end is the preservation of property.
* "Beginning with the assumptions made by explorers to the new world in their travel books, translated by Locke in his philosophical treatise into a powerful political doctrine of civil conversion, the Indian has found himself and will continue to be, for the next three centuries, a distorted inversion of civil society, and the ultimate victim of such myths."

## Colonialism and natural law
* 17th century natural law theorists were influenced by the colonial interests of their particular countries of origin.
* "Natural law, which can be traced back to the time of Cicero and beyond, is transformed during the 1600's by the need to answer new questions posed both on sea and land by the expanding colonial empires of Europe."
* Grotius: _De Jure Pradae_ (law of prize). Twelfth chapter became _Mare Liberum_ (freedom of the seas). Purpose was to assert Dutch rights to trade in the East Indies.
* Movable versus immovable objects: enclosure is necessary to private ownership. The sea cannot be bounded ergo it is free.
* Beggining with Grotius (then Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau), the natural state as developed from Cicero though Aquinus is grafted on to the European notion of America and its natives.
* "Christianity and legal theory are fused and become, through natural law, the singular viewpoint for understanding the new world and its inhabitants."
* Natural right: Grotius is concerned primarily with the rights of nations or companies rather than individuals.
* Grotius redefines _ius gentium_ from law _of_ nations to law _between_ nations. Implicit here is that man under natural law in the state of nature is equivalent to European nations under the same law with the same natural rights. "The state of nature becomes a metaphor for explaining the relationship between state which have no overarching authority beyond that of God and natural law. War is an assumed condition under these circumstances of colonial competition, and is also taken to be natural between the individuals in such a state."
* Property begins with positive common ownership, a grant from God.
* Lands that lie "unoccupied" are open to appropriation. "Grotius, like Locke, believes that unoccupied land is that which is 'hitherto uncultivated'." This applies not to property in Europe but to lands held as colonial acquisitions by European countries and not yet settled.
* On war. Can be fought on three grounds: defence, recovery of property, punishment.
* "Grotius provides specific justification for war against native inhabitants of the Americas or East Indies by those who understand and are better followers of the natural law."
* Grotius: "An unjust cuase for war is the desire for freedom among a subject people": rules out retaliatory war by natives.
* Division of war: public, private, mixed.
* Samuel Pufendorf. Student of Grotius, native of Germany, developed theory in Sweden.
* Ownership as distinct from use. Agreement decides public or private ownersip.
* Grotius and Locke: god grants property as a positive communal right of ownership. we possess everything. it is up to individuals and nations to grab claims. to use is to own. legit ownership is private an european. for locke labour rather than use.

* domination of trade against other EU nation rather than settlement was the initial goal of colonial policy in England.
* English government challenged claims of ownership by conquest with purchase and settlement as the basis of a nations right to exclude. Settling was Englands legal argument against Spanish claims of prior ownership in areas such as Carolina.
* Richard Hakluyt: _A discourse concerning western planting_, Francis Bacon: _Of Plantations_. This is where the argument for getting rid of surplus population began. Sir Charles Lucas:
* >It is difficult to understand how the soil of England can have been overpopulated in the 16th century and yet the necessity for disposing of the unemployed was a stock argument with advocates of expansion.
* The colonies were run more in the interests of profit than social welfare.
* English attitudes to the Natives were defined by their respective objectives. Traders and explorers tended to encourage the cultivation of good relations.
* James Merrell: "For all their faults, traders generally had shown a willingness to abide by the rules native society laid down. ... Settlers hardly tried. Where a trader saw profits and a crown official saw allies, a planter tended to see nothing but trouble to his mind, native neighbour were good only for obstructing settlement, threatening life and property, and attracting other Indians to the area."
* "... the native American became an obstacle in America and with the settlement of New England and the need to attract both investment and settlers, questions and debates began in England regarding the Indian's natural right to property and under what conditions Europeans could occupy and settle these 'new' lands."
* The debates in England were similar to early ones in Spain, e.g. Francisco Vitoria argued for right of travel, trade, and propagation of Christianity. Where denied, war and seizure of goods and enslavement was deemed legitimate.
* Early English colonists distinguished themselves as peaceful as compared with the Spanish. They were not in a position of conduct warfare.
* _Vacuum domicilium_. Thomas More perhaps first writer to use the term in relation to the Americas. The claim that land was vacant provided English settler and their defender with their justification for war.
* Four reasons for recognising Native natural right to land. 1. To distinguish oneself from the Spanish conquistador. 2. to secure claims against Indian atttack. 3. To prove ownership to another European power (legal possession could be created out of material such as 'natural rights' by the simple process of manufacturing legal forms). 4. Sincere belief that Natives, unlike Black slaves, had natural rights.
* "It was the transformation of English colonisation from trade to settlement which made the Natives less facilitators of English growth than obstacles in the way of its continuing colonial spread."
* There was a belief that Natives, unlike Africans, were rational, educable and potentially Christian men. Like Europeans at an earlier stage of development. Descendents of the 10 lost tribes of Israel.
* The initial purpose of colonisation was to Christianise Native, expand empire, and through investment secure private economic gains and honour. At the beggining of 17th century trading, mining, and exploration. By the end, settlement and plantations.

## Colonialism - economic and ethical debates.

## Carolina - A colonial Blueprint

* "The first requirement of any colony is people, enough to ensure the stability of the settlement."
* "The role of the Spanish colonies and their approach to the new world during this period ... is fundamental to an analysis fo teh English method of colonisation." p.237
* The Spanish approach was based on the right of conquest justified on the basis of Native refusal to obey 'natural law'. Settlement was no necessarily the aim of Spanish colonizers.
* The relationship between the Spanish and the Indians was generally considered by English colonists to be one in which the rights of the latter were not respected by the former.
* Carolina provides a clear blueprint of the elements necessary to a successful English plantation.
* 1. People the land, 2. ensure the cultivation of the land, keeping in proportion the amound of land enclosed to the number of people present, 3. establish towns to make trade more efficient, 4. industrious individuals rather than idle or poor were to be encouraged to settle, 5. mining and other forms of 'plundering' for riches was rejected, 6. Native lives, liberty, and property (as defined by English law) were to be respected, no slavery. Appropriation occur by mean of peaceable industry and purchase of land rather than through violent conquest. 7. pantations would succeed only if there was a good government with correct laws obeyed by all.
