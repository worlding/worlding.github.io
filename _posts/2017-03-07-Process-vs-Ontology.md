## Process ontology

Patrick Wolfe:
"the key left problematic is the _process of exclusion_ rather than the _ontology of those excluded_" (p.118)

"Since exclusion operates generally but produces different categories-for-exclusion in particular sociohistorical contexts, exclusion is prior to the ontology of those excluded."

No category for exclusion is stable. All are produced by the rule of exclusion and, as such, contingent and contestable.

"race or ethnicity cannot be taken as just there or given, prior to the social process and available for exclusion to operate on them. Rather, race and ethnicity are made in the excluding"
