Radical uncertainty.

Ontological uncertainty: the fundamental unknowability of the future.

Our responses to uncertainty are necessarily and irresolvably conflicted.

Our approach to uncertainty is paradoxical. We contrain that quality that makes our lives worthwhile.

Political disputes can be read as differing responses to uncertainty.

Hayek was concerned with uncertainty created for businesses by the state.

Keynes emphasised the experience of uncertainty amongst everyday people.

Designing a political order required decisions about what kinds of uncertainty can or should be mitigated.

Qualitative responses to uncertainty.

Uncertainty resists quantification so our engagment with it ought to include literary and philosophical sources.

These questions were marginalised in economics shifted to other disciplines, futures research.

Copying something can be a good strategy for dealign with uncertainty. Looking around and copying what works fails when the environment around it changes.

We create stories for ourselves that give us the confidence to make decisions. [Regulating affect] Keynes, "animal spirits", we build things on the basis of having been convinced of a story.

Conviction narratives.

Textual databases help to measure psychological states.

The implication is the need for different models of behaviour.

Cultural probes.

Our information about markets is not evenly distributed.

The real question is the production of a class of the _radically certain_ have access to power to correct mistakes that others do not.
