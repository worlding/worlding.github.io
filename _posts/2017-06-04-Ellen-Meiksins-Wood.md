From _The Origins of Capitalism: A Longer View_ by Ellen Meiksins Wood. 2002

## Comerce and or capitalism?

Capitalist, bourgeois; capitalism, city. Not the same.

>there have, throughout history, been a great many town and a great deal of trade that never gave rise to capitalism. For that matter, there have been elaborate urban settlements -- such as the temple cities of ancient empires -- that have not been commerical centres. More particularly, there have been societies with advanced urban cultures, highly developed trading system, and far-flung commericial networks that have made ample use of market _opportunities_ but have not systematically experienced what we have been calling market _imperatives_.
p.75

>the emergence of capitalism is difficult to explain precisely because it bears no relation to prior superiority or more advanced development in commerical sophistication, science and technology, or 'primitive accumulation' in the classical sense of material wealth.
p.75

>The critical factor in the divergence of capitalism from all other forms of 'commerical society' was the development of certain social property relations that generated market imperatives and capitalist 'laws of motion', which imposed themselves on production.
p.76

"the pressures of competitive production and profit-maximization, the copulsion to reinvest surpluses, and the relentless need to improve labour-productivity"

Trade, even with money, does not by itself "generate the need to maximize profit and, even less, to produce competitively"

>Profit by means of carrying trade or arbitrage between markets has strategies of its own. These do not depend on transforming production, nor do they pro,ote development of the kind of integrated market that imposes competitive imperatives. On the contrary, they thrive on fragmented markets and movement between them, rather than competition within a single market; and the links between production and exchange may be very tenous.

Rivalries and wars over trade were less to do with competitive production of the capitalist kind than with 'extra-economic' factors such as superior shipping, domination of the seas and other transport routes, monopoly privileges, or highly developed financial institutions and instruments of arbitrage, typically supported by military force.

No systemic need to lower the costs of production in order to prevail in price competition.

Profits were made by buying cheap and selling dear or carrying goods from one market to another, rather than producing more cost-effectively in direct competition with others in the same market. Profit in circulation rather than production.

>While all kind of people might people might buy and sell all kinds of things in the market, neither the peasant-proprietors who produced, nor the landlords and officholder who appropriated what others produced, depended directly on the market for the conditions of their self-reproduction, and the relations between them were not mediated by the market.

Claim: _Capitalism was born when market imperatives seized hold of food production_

## The agrarian origin of capitalism

The difference between pre-capitalis societie and capitalism has "nothing to do with whether production is urban or rural and everything to do with _the particular property relations between producers and appropriators_". "Only in capitalism is the dominant mode of appropriation based on the complete disposession fo direct producers"

Systemic requirements of market dependence: competition, accumulation, profit-maximization. Constant need to develop the productive forces. Constant expansion.

In the 11th century the Norman ruling class established itself as a fairly cohesive military and political entity.

English agriculture in teh 16th century was unique in many ways. 1. the ruling class was distinctive in two respects a) demilitarized and part of the centralised state, in alliance with centralizing monarchy, without parcellization of sovereignty so less access to autonomous coercive power. b) big landlord with increasing 'economic' powers. A large proportioin of land was worked by tenants ("farmer" means tenant). Weak extra-economic powers of landlords. Landlords had an inventive to encourage and compel tenants to find ways of reducing costs by increasing labour-productivity. Tenants subject to rents fixed to market conditions rather than legal or customary standards. Tenants had to compete for access to land.

A new mentality emerges as landlord's surveyors begin to compute the rental value of land on the basis of a more or less abstract principle of market value and measures it against the rents of customary tenants. The rudiments of more sophisticated theories of value.

The creation of a propertyless mass that constituted both a large wage-labour force and a domestic market for cheap consumer goods -- a type of market with no historical precedent.

"the English were preoccupied with market valuations and competitive rents at a time when French peasants were consolidating rights of inheritance and French lords had little benefit from rents, the French surveyor was obsessively combing the records for any sign of seigneurial rights and peasant obligations that could be revived -- or even invented. So while the English went in search of 'real' market values, the French were using the most up-to-date and scientific methods to chart a revival of feudalism."









Why did imperialism produce industrial capitalism in England and not other places?

Colonial wealth is incidental to the development of imperatives generated by England's domestic property relations.

"The new dynamics of a growing capitalist system produced a new form of colonization and a new kind of imperial drive: not just the age-old hunger for wealth and pluder but, mroe specicially, and outward expansion of the same capitalist imperatives that were driving the domestic market, the imperatives of competitive production and capital accumulation."

Created motives for coercive dispossesion. Previously, land with labour attached that was accessible to extra-economic coercion is generally more valuable than land by itself. Command over people more immediately important than command over land.

England was unique in producing a surplus population.

In Ireland the Tudor state attepted to exert both extra-economic control and economic hegemony. Using military force to implant a new economic system, as well as a new political and legal order.

"the new strategy was to compel Irish chieftains to adapt to the transplanted commerical economy, and to adopt English landlord-tenant relation, to become improving--and expropriating--landlords, and even to encourage the settlement of English and Scots as tenants on their land."

A founding contradition of capitalism: "the need to impose its imperatives as universally as possible, and the need to limit the damaging consequences that this universalization has for capital itself."

Tudor colonialism 'was the chief legacy of late Elizabethan Ireland to English colonization in the New World'

"Englishmen schooled in the Irish colonial venture transported their experience to the American colonies ..."

"For the Irish themselves, expropriation, from very early on, often meant migration to the colonies."

"The Irish model, then, represented a pattern of imperial settlement different from other European empires, a form of colonial dominaiton that replaced existing property relation with new ones driven by market imperatives."

"today, the old role of colonial settlers as means of transporting economic compulsion has been taken over by local nation states, which act as transmission belts for capitalist imperatives and enforce the 'laws' of the market."

As labour-productivity became imperative, that imperative made its way into new conceptions of property rights. Improvement became the basis of right. Failure to improve meant forfeit of that right.

Sir John Davies, a principal figure of Enlish imperialism in Ireland in the early 17th century. Developed legal arguments to justify the Ulster plantation, the eviction of the Irish, and their replacement by Englishmen and Scots.

80 years before Locke's _Second Treatise of Governement_ Davies gives essential the same argument for colonial settlement that Locke made for dispossessing American Natives and the enclosure in England.

1. That the king has supreme right over the land not only in English common law but also by Irish customary law.
2. The king is not only entitled by law but also bound in conscience to reduce his people from barbarism to civility. They would not "build houses, make townships or villages, or manure or improve the land as it ought to be". "it stands neither with Christian policy nor conscience to suffer so good and fruitful a country to lie waste like a wilderness, when his Majesty may lawfully dispose it to such persons as will make a civil plantation thereupon."
3. It tends to the good of the natives for half their land lies in waste, which accounts for why the inhabited areas are "not improved to half their value"

"Improvement" = the increase in exchange value derived from increasing productivity. Neither occupancy nor fruitful use mattered. Stealing the land added something.

Ireland was a laboratory for English social theory and natural science. Tested agricultural techniques as pilot projects.

The English were not the first to justify imperial expansion but they introduced innovations.

"It seems to have been in England that it was first suggested -- notably by Thomas More, as early as 1516, in his _Utopia_ that the seizure of vacant land could be justified even without the consent of the local sovereign, though it was Locke who gave this principle a systemic theorization."

For John Davies and John Locke the issue is not simply occupancy but relative value.

"In effect, the English redefined vacancy by redefining _waste_"

English colonisers "found their justification in economic rather than extra-economic moral or religious principles, or, more precisely, economic principles took on a moral and religious meaning."
