# Archipelago of Risk
Mitropoulos, 2016

>Whereas Marx's discussion of political economy's understanding of the circuits of industrial capital emphasised the energy and capacity generated within the 'hidden abode' of labour, or the crises of realisation that occurred in circulation, contemporary risk analysts derive an estimate of value from speculations on uncertainty through correlations of intensities of divergent qualities and their conversion into the extensive, divisible language of geometry - or, briefly put: the use of technical procedures for assigning values to affective intensity and calculable risk, respectively. Uncertainty, in this sense, is the intensive, or affective , dimension of risk analytics. 167

Spinoza on affect: 'anything that increases or diminishes' the body's capacity ot act and the mind's capacity to think.
>Affect, by this definition, refers to combined stocks, or 'joint-stock', as in the pooling of risk through joint-stock companies that trade on stock exchanges. Uncertainty in this abstract sense is not a feeling so much as a concept around which techniques for ascertaining the value of feelings _about an unknowable future_ emerged across the field of insurance, economics and philosophy.

Knight: the conditions of above average profits and losses are uncertainty and borders.

* The calculation of risk is concerned with _a priori_ and statistical knowledge derived 'from an inductive study of a large group of cases'.
* Formulations of uncertainty are based on estimates.
* Uncertainty arises where 'there is no possibility of forming in any way groups of instances of sufficient homogeneity to make possible a quantitative determination of true probability'
* In Knights's schema, the threshold between uncertainty and borders is where the possibility of above-average rates of profit and losses emerges.
* He construed uncertainty as a mechanism of selection.
* Contemporary analytics of risk have turned to that which is in excess of both the empirical present and a strictly calculable future.
* Delineation and classification are integral to the practices of valuing risk as are the drawing of connection between diverse distributions and imagined future values.

* The pricing of risk is premised on continuous classification into the future.
* Uncertainty grasps the technical inapplicability of probabilistic science to stochastic processes and to a world in which continuous, predicated classification has been challenged by the movements against enclosures.
* Social conflicts transform the classificatory schema relied upon by prior systems

Mitropoulos identifies five ways in which Australia's Immigration Detention Network incorporates uncertainty into the analytics and systems of risk. Those of interest:
* Use of principlies of variable geometry in the engineering of flexible and adaptive physical constructions and contracts that seek to optimise uncertain rates of flow.  (organisational structures)
* hybridised methods of risk analysis that blend scientific and aesthetic forms of conjecture. (analytical methods)

Contemporary risk analytics places more emphasis on "pre-emptive identification of (non-linear, random) non-compliance and, simply put, 'desire'." as opposed to the identification and normalisation of deviancy.

"Statistial norms rely upon classifications of events, people, or aggregations of things (as sets) extrapoloate understandings of the charactersitics of those sets from the upper arc of the mean, and enable the discernment of ratio as an instrument of comparability in a quantified continuum ... There are no statistics without the delineations of populations or sets."

In practice, the generation of Durkheimian 'social facts' are constrained by "assumptions of classificatory self-evidence and/or the transitive character of nominalism" that allows for the "alignment of statistical reasoning with racial classifications"

Social facts: "manners of acting, thinking and feeling external to the individual, which are invested with a coercive power by virtue of which they exercise control over him"

The postivie affirmation of average naturalises "the boundaries of circumscribed populations and their attributed characteristics". The average Australian, for instance, is the product of two centuries worth of racially exclusive immigration policy. It is invoked "as both essence and value".

A splippage between what is necessary for the construction of a statistical norm, that is, the delineation (bordering) of populations, classes, or sets, and the "ascription of essential properties to a class of persons (or events, things, nations, etc) gives rise to techniques of normalisation."

_"Statistical reasoning materialises the typologies of ideational categories by making single units out of multiples ... that, in turn, become the object of action"_

Around the same time as the establishment of Mettray, Quetelet linked statistic with the speculative techniques of the probabilisitic sciences.

Problem: statistics can be used to indicate what might happen in the future based on information gathered about the frequencies of past events. But the 'law of large numbers' does not work at the level of the individual. The use of statistical norms is a function and prescriptive projection of continuous classification and delineation.

By contrast, variable geometry sees to "optimise the performance of a machine in relation to inconstant flows"

> Detention centres on Manus and Nauru are, in terms of physical design, the coralloary of mining encampments or just-in-time architecture, comprising shipping containers as accommodation units, demountables temporary fencing, and so forth.

"episodic, adaptive construction"

> Because there is no natural, uniform measure of time, instruments of abstraction (such as those of analytic geometry) are decisive to the processes that make it possibel to construct both the necessarily sequential time of exchange (as with bitcoin's blockchain) and the temporal divergences that are indispensable to even the most infinitesinal practices of arbitrage and hedging within financial markets.

> ... just as the engineering applications of variabel geometry illustrate how engines can transform in response to changing conditions by altering the proportions or aspect ratio between components, the archipelagic is similarly disposed to the variability of its components so as to be responsive to changing rates of flow, because the question is not only how to manage currents, but also the optimisation of performance in relation to those flows, _so as to generate a speculative value in excess of expenditures and the relative performance of share-markets._

> Analytic geometry (and calculus) is the shared language of engineers, statisticians, insurers, demographers and so on. It discerns the variable relationship between two or more things (such as lengths, volumes, curvature, inertia) formulated in a notational system which alphabetises a range between known data and objects whose properties are known to unknowable, from alpha to omega.

> While a variety of methods for calculating risks are put to use in the IDN, the economic value of detention is derived from the connections and delineations within and beyond those processes, made possible by the variable geometry of facility design (the re-engineering of scalable, adaptive infrastructures borrowed from military, shipping, construction and mining operations) and the similarly variable contingency provisions of contractual arrangements, accounting procedures and securities.

Similar to Gordon and Filc's discussion of the creation of uncertainty in the West Bank and Gaza, the IDN is "characterised by the destruction of the ability of those who are detained to decide what risks to take with their lives, with the result that suicide and self-harm are extraordinarily high, and rise in direct proportion to increases in the uncertainty created by indefinite detection" [remembering the relation between intensity and uncertainty]


Aesthetic and affective treatments of uncertainty are integral to the process of its analysis and management.

Contemporary risk analytics are concerned with gleaning a measure of the risk of risk through "the correlation of uncorrelated -- oftentimes imagined, therefore aesthetic -- volatilities."

"there is a point to the close alignment of financial and aesthetic registers of the speculative"

Possible worlds, modal logic, scenario planning.

"The limits of these include the intial assigned pick of variables, the formulation of constants, priors, and nominalism (or predicates) derived from past frequencies or norms. Seeing to move beyond these limits, there has been an increasing emphasis on 'the art' of risk analysis."

"... calls for the 'hybridisation' of risk analytics -- the blending of aesthetic, financial and scientific practices, or a variety of methods for introjecting the incalculable into the calculable through forums involving practitioners across these fields and techniques -- has been the mainstay of discussion of risk for the previous thirty years."

Contrast between "aesthetically-immersive, edgy-but-safe enjoyment and marketing of uncertainty" and the "active creation of 'pathway uncertainty'" for detainees. 180

"in the analytics of risk it is the correlation of otherwise uncorrelated frequencies of event distribution and speculations on the future in bounded sets of comparable but diverse times that generates value

Elsewhere:

"Marx's approach (informed I think by a Judaic prohibition on representing God), is not consonant with the usual definition of utopian. He shifts the conventional terms of this contrast between realism and speculation: for Marx, what we think of as imagined is – precisely because we can imagine it – an idealised variant of what exists, and therefore its projection into the future."
