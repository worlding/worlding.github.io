Classical argument.
Regarding the claim: Knowledge is possible.
Dogmatists or Epistemists - True
Academic skeptics - False. We know nothing. Knowledge requires _eliminating all doubt._ On which Descartes modelled his thinking.
Pyrrhonian Skeptics - Unknown



The skeptical attitude as demonstrated in Decartes' calls into question certainties. It demands reasons for things including reasons for why we might believe anything to be true or knowable. Scepticism is useful for challenging things that have been naturalised or taken for granted but it can also have negative effects, including the construction of a certain distancing. This is based on the presumed split between mind and extension that sceptical thought relies upon.

One of the weaknesses is that it elides one's attachment to the world. As Heidegger helps us to understand, we are always already in the world as a condition of being able to pose sceptical questions. The sceptic who ignores this opens up the possibility denying aspects of our involvement in the world, and constructing images of human that are centred on cognition. Modern scpeticism correlates with the liberal notion of the rational, autonomous, soveriegn individual. Scepticism also leads to a search for rational foundations, which opens up the possibility of fundamentalism and nihilism.

Relfection need not be the same thing as scepticism. In reflecting we think about our experiences, we don't necessarily call them into question. Reflection need not deny our being-in-the-world nor presuppose the split between mind and extension. Reflection can be a way of thinking about patterns of experience.
