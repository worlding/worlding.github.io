* Vitoria's treatise "evinces the beginnings of the shift Carl Schmitt identifies from the papal authority of the _respublica Christiana_ to modern international law."
* The account is proto-secular and proto-racial. 453
* With Grotius a shift from papal authority to title by discovery becomes evident. His 1642 _On the Origin of the Native Races of America_ "evinces early conceptions of race in terms of lineage"
* we see early examples of race's "fixity and fluidity"

## Respublica Christiana

* Schmitt: "[t]hose Christian princes and peoples who were engaged in land- and sea-appropriations, still within the spatial order of the _respublica Christiana_ of the Middle Ages, had a common ground in their Christian faith and a common authority in the head of the Church, the Roman pope."
* In the bull _Ramanus Pontifex_ of 1455 Pope Nicholas V settled a dispute over land in Africa between Portugal and Spain by granting Portugal exlcusive rights to conquer and trad in an extensive soutner region of the continent.
* Following the "discovery" of the Americas, Pope Alexander VI issed the bull _Inter Caetera_, indiating more explicitly that only Christian rulers could legitimately claim land ownership.
* The pope granted possession of "countries and island thus unknown and hitherto discovered by your envoys and to tbe deiscovered hereacter, provided however they at no time have been in the actual termporal possession of any Christian owner."
* Schmitt: After the spatial order of the _respublica Christiana_ and its theological arguemnts were undermined, "the only justification for the great land-appropriatons of non-European territory by European powers was _discovery_"
* Vitoria played a influential role in the shift from a Christian republic to a Eurocentric law of nations.

## Vitoria "On the Indians"

* Ownership does not prevent anyone from being a true owner as "onwership and dominion are based on natural or on human law; therefore they are not destroyed by want of faith." 456
* Vitoria: "Christians have a right to preach and declare the Gospel in barbarian lands."
* Anghie: while Vitoria curtails the power of the pope, once he established the authority of a secular _jus gentium_ administered by the sovereign he reintroduces Christian norms within this secular system.
* "proselytizing is authorized now, not by divine law, but the law of nations, and may be likened to the secular activities of traveling and trading."
* Indians are not "irrational animals" but more analogous to "boys"
* In Vitoria's though a racial conception emerges alongside a reconfiguration of religion.
* a war waged to secure the right of missioning is just and indigenous peoples' lands may be rightly appropriated in the course of such a just war.
>This shifting role of religion and the rule of law became apparent in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century international law when the papally-awarded legal titles of Portugal and Spain were no longer valid, leaving "discovery and occupation as the only legal title to land-appropriation recognised by the European powers." [Schmitt] With the receding role of religion as a source of legal authority, race began to shape the emergent modern international law.

## Grotius's role in the development of modern international law and race

* Grotius was "retained by the Dutch East India Company to justify  the capture by one of tis ships of a Protuguese galleon in the straits of Malacca" in 1602.
* Grotius approvingly cites Vitoria's position on the rights of missioning and free _commercium_ as a basis for just war.
* Grotius concurs with Vitoria on the question of non-Christian rights to their possessions and the limits of papal authority.
* Grotius differs from Vitoria in endorsing the discovering doctrine. Possession and occupation woudl be crucial elements of legal title for Grotius. He argued the Portuguese have not right by title of discovery to sovereignty over the East Indies because they failed the test of discovery and possession.
* Grotius:
>"[N]atural reason itself [and] the precise words of the law ... show clearly that the act of discovery is sufficient to give a clear title of sovereignty only when it is accompanied by actual possession"
* This applies to "movables or to such immovables [i.e., land] as are actually inclosed within fixed bounds and guarded." Here Grotius foreshadows the Lockean inclosure as a means of land appropriation. 462.
* Grotius priviledges theology and (invoking "precise words of the law") a positivistic, formal conception fo law.
* With Vitoria on proto-secularist divestment of papal temporal authority and the right of missioning.
* "I suggest ... that Grotius's work indicates that this transition [from Christian republic to secular internatinal law] to modern international law is marked by _race_, and, relatedly, by emerging conceptions of land and sea."

* "I suggest that associating the inappropriable sea with wasted (or empty) land subejct to appropriation was a formative element of modern international law." 463

* Gil Anidjar, the "liquefaction" of land, "the conquest of the New World defined entire stretches of territorial spaces as 'free space,' defining them, in other words, as sea spaces."
* "Grotius's racial thinkign marks an elemetnal moment in this rise of the notion of appropriabel land with dispossessable inhabitants; this idea was crucially formative in international law."
* for Grotius, "the indigenous Americans represented German, Norwegian, and Scandinavian customs of the ditant past, frozen in primitivity."
