>It was taken as a given that humanity is (almost) agreed that 'positive peace' is a desired condition, in spite of possible diagreement as to its precise content. The value of peace, like that of health connoted a functioning and integrated social system and thus took on an objective, non-disputable quality. By extension, the role of the peace researcher was to be that of a technician-physician dedicated tot eh preservation and improvement of the health of the global body politic.

>Since Galtung never provided any evidence of a consensus as to the content of the autotelic value of peace, the only conclusion can be that Galtung though it to be self-evidently reasonable.

These are criticisms of Galtung's earlier work. Nevertheless, Lawler maintains that "Galtung's revised model of peace research also fails to adequately account for its normative premises."

Late 1960s neo-Marxist critiques (Schmid, Olsen, Jarvad, Eckhardt, Dencik):
>For the radicals, Galtung's approach negelected teh poltiical-economy of relations between the developed and underdeveloping worlds and in tis attempt to preserve a symetrical approach to violent conflect was guilty of 'idealistic universalism'. From the persepctive of the oppressed, an argument for the frurther integration of the inernational system was tantamount to defending a status quo which reflected the interests of teh dominant states and teh beneficiaries of the world capitalist economy. Against this, the radicals called for a peace research that openly sides with the exploited and advocated the 'sharpening' of teh various _latent_ conflincts of interests that characterised global politics.

These critiques lead to the introduction of the concept of structural violence. Galtung theorised it as the prevention of individuals realising their potential.

>The fundamental problem with the concept of structural violence was that it was vacuous without a substantiation of the value-system on which it depended. The denial of potentiality by structural violence, presupposed some notion of human potential.

>Needs theory is inescapably teleological -- it requires for its defence a prior standard of human excellence within which arguments for the satisfaction of needs can be grounded.

>In order for a theory of human needs to have critical effect, it must be able therefore to distinguish between true and false needs, a fact acknowledged by many needs theorists.
