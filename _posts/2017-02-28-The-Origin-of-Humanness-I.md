# Preface

The basic claim:

> the history of living systems is one in which both living and variations in the manner of living have been conserved through the systemic reproduction of both the condition and manner of living as lineages of different kinds of living systems.

Terms to clarify:
* Systemic reproduction
* Condition of living
* Manner of living

Throughout the book Maturana and Verden-Zöller reflect upon the consequences of what they think, explain, and claim about human life. Scientists have made science their _professional manner of living_, so what happens with their finding and explanations is a matter that concerns them.

The reflections are not part of the argument but an invitation to the reader to make their own reflections. Reflections are not scientific statements.

# Prologue

Modern human beings live in strife with each other, and suffer for it.

Religious and political systems are invented in order to save human beings from mutal exploitation and abuse. Most of the time these efforts have failed. Humanising paradigms end up being dehumanising.

Despite our failures, how is it that human beings have ethical concerns? How is it that human beings care for each other?

Maturana and Verden-Zöller believe these questions can be answered as features of daily life.

At best, war changes the domain in which conflicts takes place rather than resolve it.

According to Maturana and Verden-Zöller, "the solution in _mutual respect_, when it happens, belongs to our ethical concern as a feature of the biology of love."

Maturana Verden-Zöller use Declaration of Human Rights as an example. "How is it that we had ethical concerns then?"

[But who is the "we" here? The liberalism of Maturana Verden-Zöller is a problem.]

"Are ethical concerns the product of our reason or of our emotions?"

[Ethical concerns are the product of ontological designing. We are ontologically designed to respond to situations through the training of impulse and identification. Reason only enters the picture when there is a breakdown, when we feel we have to think about a situation. Ordinary ethics is a located in the everyday habitual coping.]

The purpose of the book is to explain how it is that humans are _love-dependent animals_.

# Fundaments

On the biological and epistemological fundaments.

## Explaining

>In general terms, explanations are answers to questions that demand an explanation as an answer and which are accepted such by a listener. In particular term, an explanation is the proposition of a _generative mechanism or process_, such that that which the observer wants to explain arises as a result or consequence of its operation.

In explanation, the observer deals with two non-intersecting phenomenal domains:
* the phenomenal domain in which the generative mechanism takes place
* the phenomenal doamin in which the explained phenomenon occurs

Explanations cannot constitute phenomenal reductions. An explanation is not the expression of a phenomena in more basic terms but, rather, a proposed generative mechanism that gives rise to the phenomenon or experience to be explained.

[Is ontological designing a generative mechanism or a phenomenon to be explained? Is ontological designing a variety of explaination something? It seems that ontological designing is more on the side of explanation. No one really asks the question of what explains ontological designing. It makes more sense to use ontological designing as a way to explain why or how certain things happen.]

We do not explain processes that occur external to us or take place independent from our doings.

What we explain is our experience, what we experience as happening to us or in us. _When Maturana and Verden-Zöller speak of phenomena they mean experiences._

>we use our experiential coherences in one domain to propose an explanation of our experiental coherences in another domain. [...] we always explain relying completely on the regularities of our experiences.

* Condition of acceptance

An explanation has a formal aspect, whatever is proposed as the explanation.

For a generative mechanism to be accepted it must satisfy come condition that the observer adds from their own choice, or prefrence, as they listen. _This condition is the informal aspect of any explanation._ It can be anything at all. It may be explicit or implicit, the listener may be aware of it or not.

There are as many different kinds of explanation as there are different kinds of informal conditions.

The informal condition of scientific explanation is what Maturana calls the _criterion of validation._

[From Appendix 1] The criterion of validation for scientific explanations constists of four operations:
1. A description of what an observer must do to have the experience to be explained. [Arbitrary, poetic]
2. A proposed generative mecahnism such that if it is allowed to operate, the result is that the observer has the experience to be explained. [Arbitrary, poetic]
3. The deduction from all the operational coherences entailed in point 2 of other experiences that an observer could have, and of what operations he or she should do to have them [the engineering of doing science]; and
4. The realization by an observer of the operations deduced in point 3. If the observer has the experience deduced in point three then point 2 becomes a scientific explanation. [the engineering of doing science]

Further points:
* An observer is any person making distinctions.
* Scientific explanation does not require an observer to assume an independent reality.
* In scientific explanations an observer does not explain an independent reality, _nor a world independent of what they do._ Rather, _an observer explains their world of experiences and the coherences among these experiences._
* Prediction and control are not features of the criterion of validation of scientific explanations.
* When there is understanding, _effective action_ is possible _within the domain of operational coherence proper to the domain of understanding._
* The criterion of validation for scientific explanations is the same as in daily life. The difference rests in that the scientist aims at distinguishing the proper domain of any explanation and is prepared to abandon an accepted explanation when the scientific criteria are no longer satisfied.
* Science permits us to explain human experience useing human experience and the coherences of human experience. Because of this science transforms human life. We change the world we live as we live it through science.
* The choice fo experience to explain and the proposal of generative mechanisms are acts of poetic free imagination.
* The power of explanations to affect human life rests on the fact that they are _manners of coordinations of coordinations of behavior_.
* "... explanations do not deal with an independent reality but are manners of interpersonal realtions and deal, in fact, with the coordinations of our behavior in the flow of our coexistence with other human beings."
* Through explanations we change our living and the world we live.
* Reality as referenced in Western patriarchal culture is an explanatory assumption, an imagined domain of independent entities that we use in order to give a universal validity to our explanations of our experiences.
* But what gives validity to scientific explanations is the the application fo the criterion of validation for scientific explanations.
* If we do not release our belief in an independent reality we cannot understand that predictions of particular events do not belong to the domain of science but to the domain of design.
* In daily life we usually speak as if dealing with objective entities that belong to an independent reality, as though the things we refer to exist untouched by our manner of distinguishing them.
* In these circumstances "reality" is used to account for the repetitiveness of our experiences.
* We live in as many different domains of reality as we live different domains of experiential coherences.
* If we attempt to validate what we say by claiming that we have a privileged access to an independent reality we demand obedience in our relations and we become tyrants.
* __In the use of science for the prediction or design of possible events the observer must be careful to create their computations and designs without losing awareness of the domain of operational coherence in which the scientific explanation in question applies, and that this use is connected with human life.__
* What we explain is experience. We explain experience with the coherences of the coherences of experience. As such "reality" and "existence" are explanatory notions.
* For epistemological reasons we rely upon the notion of a substratum that makes possible that which the observer distinguishes, including the observer's own self distinction. But it is not possible to say anything about that substratum other than it permits what it permits in the domain of the living of a specific observer.

To explain human beings and human life one has to propose a generative mechanism that will give rise to human life and to all aspects of human beingness. If one wants such a generative mechanism to be accepted as an explanation in its own terms, _one must make explicit [or at least consider, as full explication is arguably impossible] the informal condition that defined the domain in which one claims it to be valid._

E.g. Maturana and Verden-Zöller want to speak about human beings as biological entities and explain their biological origin. They propose a biological generative mechanism such that the human manner of living and human beingness may result as a consequence of its operation.

This book is concerned not only with the origins of the human lineage but also "the features of our modern human cultural life."

## Lineaging

>The particular ontogenic phenotype in fact lived by an organism as it interacts in a medium arises systemically moment by moment through the structural changes that the organism and the medium trigger in each other in their recurrent interaction.

>A particular ontogenic phenotype is conserved as a lineage through reproduction only as long as realization fo the manner of living which gives rise to that phenotype contributes to create the conditions under which it can be repeated in the next generation.

>This the constitution of a lineage is a systemic process or phenomenon that involves both organism and medium ...

>The process fo systemic realization of a manner of living or ontogenic phenotype is called in biology epigenesis, and we call the relational dynamics of its realization, _ontogenic structural shift._

The consequences for the study: "if we want to explain our human origin, we must propose as a generative mechanism the systemic conservation of a manner of living."

## Domains of existence

>whenever there is a collection of living systems that forma a network of direct and indirect recursive interactions in thre realization fo their living, a biosphere arises as a closed network of multidomensional reciprocal structural couplings that includes all the living systems as well as all the non-living features of the medium that participate in it.

>as human beings we are neither our bodyhoods, nor our behaviour, rather we are a continuous systemic dynamics that takes place in the interplay between bodyhood and behavior, and we exist as languaging beings in a relational sace that arises in that dynamics.

Human existence is an historical process.

## Languaging

Language is a manner of living in recurrent interactions in a flow of coordinations or coordinations of consensual behaviors.

Consensual does not refer to consent but is that coordination of behaviour which takes place in a flow of coherent transformations in the absense of stipulation, as in the case of agreement.

Consensuality does not require language. It is the spontaneous coordination of behaviour. It is totally different from agreement.

Coordination happens without language throughout the biosphere. _It is the recursion on coordination, that is coordination of coordinations, which constitutes language._

_"Languaging" is the recursive flow of consensual coordinations of behaviors._

Human beings exist in the braiding of languaging and emotioning. This is called _conversation._

No way of living arises out of necessity: as a new manner of living begins to be systemically conserved, everything else (including the genetic system) becomes open to change around what is conserved. We are the present of a phylogenic drift, not an attainment.

Language is a domain of doings.

## Objects

>OUr daily experience is that we distinguish entities as if they existed independently from our distinguishing them.

>Objects arise in language as coordinations fo coordinations of doings that constitute a field of shared coordinations fo doings that we call a _domain of interobjectivity,_ and which is felt by those who live it as a _domain of shared entities_.

## Emotioning

When we distinguish an emotion or mood is a doain of _relational behaviours_, not a particular doing.

>In a way, a change of emotion or mood is a change of brain and body. Through different emotions human and non-human animals become different beings, beings that see differently, hear differently, move and act differently. In particular, we human beings become different rational beings, and we think, reason, and reflect differently as our emotions change. We move in the drift of our living following a path guided by our emotions.

> ... the emotion of love as a domain of actions, is the domain of those relational behaviors through which another arises as a legitimate other in coexistence with oneself.

>Emotions create the systemic relational dynamics which conserve them, and a change of emotion entails a badic shift in the systemic relational dynamics of the participants. Different emotions enail different relational behaviours.
Eg
* Relations of power create resentment. Love, as it operates in self-respect and self-acceptance, brings with itsef well being.
