# Wondering the World Directly - or, How Movement Outruns the Subject
by Erin Manning (2014)

Questions. (paraphrased)
- Movement produces the body. The question for Manning is how.
- How does Merleau-Ponty's concept of the subject interfere with "bodying"
- What happens when phenomenology meets process philosophy

Three propositions
- There is never a body as such: what we know are edgings and contourings, forces, and intensities: _a body is its movement_
- Movement is not to be reduced to displacement
- A philosophy of the body never begins with the body: it _bodies_

In his late writings, Merleau-Ponty engages Whitehead's process philosophy. This puts into question many of the central postulates of phenomenology, most significantly, "the relationshop between consciousness and experience".

In _The Visible and the Invisible_ (1968, p.200), Merleau-Ponty acknowledges that "what he calls the 'consciousness-object' distinction at the heart of his _Phenomenology of Perception_ has led him astray."

Other phenomenological starting points in Merleau-Ponty challenged by Whitehead:
- that there is a perceiving subject
- that the feltnes of the world edges into experience through the human who remains central to the world's appearance
- that sensation is equal to experience

# Whitehead

"experience is a worlding that produces 'subjective forms' but is never pre-supposed by them"

Sensation is a secondary phase of perception (prehension) that begins with the force of a relational attunement (causal efficacy) based on the in-act of a singular set of conditons from which, for some forms of life, a second phase, "presentational immediacy", emerges (the experience of quality as it expresses itself in a field of sensation).

>Relation and sensation are co-composing in experience, participatory in the direct experience of a world in-forming. The subject does not precede this experience, it is in-formed by it.

Human experience is not primary: perception is in the world and not of or for the world.

"Mereleau-Ponty's turn to Whitehead arguably brings phenomenology to its limit, a limit that is more than human ...

>The force fo process philosophy lies in its ability to create a field for experience that does not begin and end with the human subject. There is no subject 'of' experience, no consciousness outside of the event of its unfolding.

Key relation: the actual (becoming) and the virtual

There is a complex intertwing between an _actual occasion_ (what is absolutely what it has become or is becoming) and "_what is in the realm of potential_ and can express itself ... only in its effects, in its contribution to the in-act of experience."

Bergson: the experience of time is always a subtraction from a virtual duration. The subtraction alters the tenor of the durational field it was culled from.

"There are always two co-composing streams of movement, one of them virtual but contributory, one of them acualized." "Total momement is the field of movement-moving, the virtual force of movement as it traverses and insinutates itself into all actual displacements, into all form-takings and ecologies of life-living."

On dancing: "it is not 'I' who is in the process of creating a dance, but the dance itself that is in the process of creating 'me', a me that in its bodying will wonder the world directly."

>There is an infinite number of tendencies-to-form that populate any given movement-event. These tendencies-to-form are steeped in habit. Though in continuous modulation, they tend to tune movement to its attainment -- this or that destination, this or that figure, this or that axis.

>all moving ultimately exceed what seems to be so firmly at movement's centre: me. Movement courses through the me that is in formation: experience, perception, feeling -- all of these are movements, and each them contributes, in an infintiy of way, to what 'I' become in any given occasion.

Bodying is the knoting of movement's tendencies

Two competing tendencies:
1. "In the experience of movement-moving's unmoorign of the 'I', we have the ingression of total movement. Movement trembles with potential."
2. "we have a subtraction from the potential eventness that reduces movement to this or that actual occasion.

"In the ontogenetic field of experience, there is not yet a category of self, of body, of external perceiver."

>Wondering the world directly, in movement, is to participate in an enfolding that challenges the centrality of the I. It is not 'I' as self-enclosed subject who is creating movement, but movement itself that is in the process fo recalibrating an 'I' that will eventually emerge, unmoored. Not '_I_ am wondering' but 'Where does this movement wonder me?' A body is never in advance of its moving.

"If we understand phenomenology as defined by Merleau-Ponty as 'study of the appearance [advent] of being to consciousness' total movement can in no way belong to the register of the phenomenological. It is felt, but cannot be reduced to being. It is sense, but not within a consciousness-of that belongs to a subject external to the event." [Quote from PoP, p.71]

"being never precedes the event"

"To know a movement 'as such' is to have culled the movement from its process."

>The 'thisness' of the 'here' of form is a mirage. For movement has not stopped. What has stopped and taken form is but a subtraction from the total field of movement -- a step, a shape, a figure always already on its way to something else.

Not two opposing realms, the finite and the infinite, the actual and the virtual, but trying to make felt what their transversal attunements call forth.
