Sandra Lee Bartky
"Originative Thinking in the Later Philosophy of Heidegger", 1970.
* Bartky concludes that later Heidegger's "notion of originative thought is far too vacuous and abstract to serve the needs of any radical world-renewing project."
* Heideggerian though provides no basis for undertaking concrete analyses of social relations because it cannot state definitively whether humans create or merely receive meaning, so offers no guidelines for a philosophy of liberation.
* Bartky's arguments echo debates about the pseudoconcreteness of Heidegger's thought that began around 1947 in teh US and Germany and came in the context of the entry of feminism into the academy.
* This prefigured an early disinterest in Heidegger in feminist research.

- critiques methodological bias of Anglophone feminist scholarship for overly exclusive focus on psychoanalytic dimension fo Irigaray's work.
- Irigaray adopts Nietzche's goal by effectuating a transvaluation of the notion of femininity

- Heideggerian ontology can supply a solid basis on which to develop a social theory sensitive to difference.

The 90s surge of interest in Heidegger on the part of feminist thinkers was made possible by the influence of Irigaray and Derrida.

Diane Elam, "Is Feminism the Saving Grace of Hermeneutics?", 1991
- feminism cannot save hermeneutics from phallocentrism. A critique of hermeneutical phenomenology proper rather than just Heideggerian phenomenology (as with Bartky)

Irigaray is more substantially Heideggerian than deconstructive.

Reception of Irigaray in the English-speaking world neglected the methodology and her understanding of thinking as an activity distinct from theorizing or philosophizing. Both orientations are adopted from Heidegger.

Irigaray is not primarily deconstructive but rather constitute a female variation on Heidegger's methdology of historical retrieval.

Bartky adopts the Heideggerian notion of mood or attunement to analyse what she takes to be the primary modality of female embodiment in US patriarchy: shame.

Mood helps us to understand that we stand first and foremost in a relation of attunment to the world of our environs rather than in a cognitive relation. _"All undertanding occurs on the basis of a mode of affective attunement that colors our perception and the overall way in which the world appears intelligible to us."_

>Attunement articulates not simply the fact that, because human beings live within a concrete situation, all knowledge claims prove context depedent. Rather, it denotes for Heidegger our relation to the cosmos as an intelligible whole.

>... every Dasein or racial [!] mode of existence is a guidepost to transcendence, to recovering an ontological sense of inherence in the cosmos proper, and not simply, as the moder view holds, a set of cultural values.

_Mythos_ -- a spontaneous expression of one's reciprocal participation in the source fo existence -- transcends the unconscious, the symbolic aspects of existence, and cultural values.
