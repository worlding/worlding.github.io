> Eugenics plays an important role in the history of white settlement in Australia. For example, a proposal which would later have been considered eugenic was suggested by Governor Arthur Phillip within the first five years of settlement. He wrote 'as I would not wish convicts to lay the foundation of an empire, I think they should ever remain separated from the garrison, and other settlers that may come from Europe and nto be allowed to mix with them, even after the seven or fourteen years from which they are transported my be expired'. p3

> In Britain, from the 1780s, dreams of progress fuelled the industrial revolution. After witnessing the material improvments which machines had facilitated, it is not surprising that in the 20th century some people dreamt of producing better people or even entertained fantasies of human perfectibility. p.4

* before the two world wars, an all-embracing, if ill-defined, concept of eugenics was propounded by many eminent Australians
* while it was largely derived from Britain and America, a variety of specifically Australian circumstances contributed to its acceptance.

Colonial circumstances conducive to the acceptance of eugenics:
* When the convict transportation ceased, fears about the taint of convict blood merged with fears about the physical quality of the 'Australian race'.
* Concerns about racial decay were prompted by Herbert Spencer and Charles Darwin.
* Social Darwinism: whites were considered to be superior and so deserved to survive regardless of the consequences for the 'unfit'
* "In 1905, Western Australia's Aborigines Act contained a clause designed to limit the growth of part-Aboriginal populations by taking the children from their parents. NSW adopted an Aboriginal protection policy in 1909 making it illegal for part-Aboriginal people to live on reserves. Amendments to the Act in 1915 and 1918 gave the NSW Aboriginal Protection Board increased powers to remove children and train them as servants."
* From 1937 the mandatory assimilation of part-Aboriginals into the white community became official Commonwealth policy.
* Regarding racial fitness: SMH editorial in 1874 used cricketing victories to reasure the national psyche that British blood had 'not yet been thinned by the heat of Australian summers'
* Declining birth-rates: "Fearfulness caused by this birth rate decline, and news that the Japanese population was increasing, both played a pivotal role in the history of eugenics in Australia."
* Racism played a lesser role in AU eugenics due to the White Australia policy.
* Charles Henry Pearson (1830-1894). Settled in Australia 1871 from England. 1893 published _National Life and Character: A Forecast_. Warned of the danger "for the higher races everywhere, if the black and yellow belt encroaches upon the earth". Robert Colls summarised the objectives of Pearson's proposals as intending to ensure that whites could retain their territory. In his schema, the state would need to intervene with a form of democratic national socialism, 'overlaid by a military autocracy with fortress duties'. The state would ensure the citizens were healthy and take care of social planning and the military would defend it.
