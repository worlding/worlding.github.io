A story of how cultural encounters "reveal the invisible spatial narratives subtending the concept of 'boundary' ..." 757

"a story about storytelling, as boundaries are basic compnents of narration."

## Ngaanyatjarra claim

Land claims require a precose delineation of the boundaries of an area, "because the mining companies wat certainty and expeditiousness in establishing their mining leases." 759

"for some Aboriginal groups, particularly those who have been displaced, there is an advantage in Western mapping and preceise boundary demarcation in the fight for autonomy and place-based self-determination" see Jacobs, 1986

"The colonial and the enlightenment projects were in large part concerned with the establishment of boundaries to determine and delimit sovereignty over territory, and authority over knowledge." 761

"The _Native Title Amnedment Act, 1998_ required that in mapping a land claim information must be provided that enables the boundaries to be identified." 761

"Tuner and Brooks invoke the term 'boundary riders' to refer to the ambassadors or go-betweens involved, and found they can "obtain outcomes through consensus on a range of issues related to representivity" (2000, page 114), a process they describe as "mapping people to country". 761

"in addition to the multiple forms of boundary making and the collision between Western European and Western Desert boundaries, a fundamental problem has been with the precise location of the state border of West Austalia, which forms the boundary with the Northern Territory and South Australia, and which is supposed to follow the the meridian --- logitude 129 degrees east." 762

## The West Australian border

"The problems of the Ngaanyatjarra Land Council encountered to reflect not ht eimprecise and indefinite nature of Aboriginal boundaries but the difficulties of determining a boundary, which at first glance look as if it is a classic, nonproblematice, exmplification of Western carographic framing in action---the imposition of an abstract, rational, scientific grid on an unmarked, messy landscape." 762

It should be the longest straight line in the world.

In reality there is a kink at the T-junction with the NT and SA borders where there are two surveyors' posts 127 metres apart. 762

The Commision for the Province of West Australia declared the border descriptively in 1831 as being the 129th meridian of east longitude.

The error is the result of an effort in 1922 to determine the location of the border line. The error was not noticed for 40 years and nothing was done to correct it. 763

Land survey done in Kimberleys 1936-37.

"... inscribing the grid on the earth is neither easily accomplished nor mreely technical; it is, as John Law would say, an example of 'heterogenous engineering', requiring as much social and literary technology as it does surveying techniques" 764

"... it is also now becoming apparent that the arbitrary division by the West Australian border of the Ngaanyatjara from the Pitjantjatjara, with whom they share religion, language, and country, is neither rational nor any longer tenable."

## Conclusion

"... we tell stories about boundaries; we use them to assert and delimit authority and to differentiate between forms of rationality."
