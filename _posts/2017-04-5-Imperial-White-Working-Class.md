# The Imperial Working Class
by Jonathan Hyslop

Argument
* "The white working classes in the pre-First World War British Empire were not composed of 'nationally' discrete entities but were mound together into an imperial working class, by flows of population which traversed the world."
* "the labour movements based on this imperial working class produced and dissemniated a common ideology of White Labourism. In this ideology, the element of the critique of exploitation and the element of racism were inextricably intermingled."
* The radical labour militancy of the early 20th century was "fused with the notion that employers were attempting to sap the organised power of white workers internationally by subjecting them to the competition of cheap Asian labour."
* "This internationally constructed synthesis of militant labour and racist visions was a major cultural source of the rise of working class racism in turn-of-the-century Britain, of the beginning of South African industrial segregation, and of the politics of the 'White Australia' policy"
* "These phenomena were not separate, but rather, part of a single story"

The relevant geo-social framework is the British Empire rather than nation-states, i.e. the direction of a labour movement cannot be understood purely in terms of the conditions prevailing inside a single country but, rather, ought to include "international flows of political culture".

The development of labour identity in SA, AU, and the UK is "inextricably tangled with notions of race."

The historical development of labour racism in the British Empire possessess distinct dynamics from those of U.S. labour, i.e. Empire and notions of Britishness.

On Alastair Bonnett's "How the British working class became white"
* "Welfarism enabled the formation of a broadly based 'national community' which attached the working class to national racial symbols and state institutions."
* "In the late twentieth century, with the crisis of the welfare state, British workers increasingly have come to feel that the welfare system which they have created, and see as theirs, is threatened. Immigrants and non-respectable whites come to be seen as the culprits."
* Moving beyong Bonnett: "both in Australia and South Africa, the early twentieth century saw the creation of a racially exclusive welfarism whch eventually underwrote the ideological incorporation of the white working class."
* "Turn-of-the-century intensification of racism and white worker assimilation into 'whiteness' were pan-British Empire developments."
* "From the 1880s, the themes of egalitarianism and racism were always intermixed in both the British and colonial labour movements."
* "Their discourse centred on the idea that they were protecting the existing organised working class against the destruction of their wage and welfare gains."
* Hyslop: "the battles which British labour fought in creating the welfare state were not conducted in an environment which was free fo racial exclusivism." British Labour, the AU Labor Party, and SA industrial segregationists "effectively demanded of the state, a combination of welfare and the protection fo racial boundaries."

The Australian labour movement played a fundamental role in the generation of a White Labourist political model.

>The formation of the international Labour movement in the late nineteenth century, fuelled by the human rivers of migration flowing around and out of Europe, occurred at the same mometn as an enormous outflow of migrants from the Fukiem and Kwantung provinces fo China and from India. It was this conjuncture which created a context in which defining themsleves and their labour marked interests as 'white' could seem an adventageous option to organised workers. Faced with potentially hightly competitive labour markets, one possibility for workers of European origin was to seek economic protection from the state by appealing to the idea that they were racial partners in empire.

Exclusionary measures against Chinese were first introduced in Victoria in the 1850s, folloing racial violence in the Bendigo area in 1854.

The 1861 manifesto of the Miner's Protective League demonstrated the combination of racism and egalitarianism calling on white diggers to "drive the moon-faced barbarian away" while also urging "men of all nations" to join the League and calling "upon every man whose spirit yearns for equality, fraternity and glorious liberty".

The employment of Chinese labour was a central grievance in the Sydney seaman's strike of 1878. In 1890 the Sheep Shearers' Union forbade the recruitment of new Chinese members. Unions played a major role in bringing about the passage of Exclusion Acts in the various Australian colonies in 1888. In 1901 Labor party made the passing of a 'White Australia' policy a condition for supporting Edmund Barton's government.

Labor MPs were more likely to be British born and more likely to be recent immigrants than MPs of other parties.

Australian labour created a militantly egalitarian polity protected by an interventionist state.

Many Australian miners and artisans moved to South Africa between 1890s and 1904. The Australian political model popular amongst the ranks of the imperial working class.

>The success of the Australian activists in influencing the South Africa labour movement arises from the way that their model squared with the aspirations and prejudices of trade union supporters, while also beling to resolve the dilemmas of egalitarian-minded activists.

Avner Offer:
>It is wrong to regard exclusion as a 'dark side' of colonial societies. Rather racism arose directly out fo their virtues of democracy, civic equality and solidarity.

The white working class on the SA goldfields, the Cornish working class and the miners of Australia were not just connected, the were to a great extent the same globally mobile individuals linked in a transcontinental network.

# The invention of the concentration camp

Key questions:
* why did the camps emerge at the turn of the century?
* what difference did the existence make?

Claim:

New cultures of military professionalism were crucial to the emergence of the concentration camp. Military porfessionalism generated military cultures that took instrumental rationality as a core value.

The history of warfare is one of massacres, rapes, and plundering of civilians, but "that is not the same as settiing out to place entire civilian populations in militarily run, bureaucratically organised institutions."

"Movements which might have been expected to see the dangerous logic of the war on civilians -- socialist and anti-imperialist groups -- did not do so, instead sharing many of the assumptions of their military antagonists."

With the rise of professionalisation military science became a distinct academic discipline.

"The shift toward conscript armies in the European states (except the UK) and the admission of workers in some countries to the electoral franchise in this period necessitated and propelled new forms of popular political identification with the nation-state."

"Armies do not need extrinsic ideologicla motivations to look for more extreme ways of winning a war. Professionalised training, I would suggest, intensifies these trends because it inculcates a rational-instrumental focus on the means of attaing military goals, but seldom asks questions about ends."

Professionalisation "led professional soldiers to see irregular troops as having placed themselves beyond the pale of the law.

Four cases
1. Cuba, 1896, Spanish against rebel forces
2. South Africa, 1899, British army against Boer guerilla forces
3. Philippines, 1899, US against Filippino guerillas
4. Southwest Africa, 1904, German forces against Herero and Nama rebels

"the South African camps' sanitary and modernising elements may in a sense have made them all the more pernicious, by legitimising the camp idea internationally."

In Hyslop's view military professionalisation and the process of war-fighting provides a better explanation for the emergence of concentration camps than generic notions of genocide, theories of biopower, and the exceptional state, analyses emphasising the role of racial ideology, or interpretations based on the idea of rational decision making.

"Genocide" is a legal category and not necessarily helpful as a basis for sociological analysis. Historians have begun to use categories such as mass killing or mass violence.

Agamben on concentration camps:
>Inasmuch as its inhabitants have been stripped of every political status and reduced completely to naked life, the camp is the most absolute biopolitical space that has ever been realized -- a space in which power confronts nothing other than pure biological life without mediation. (Means without End, p. 40)

Foucault on biopower: 'to treat the population as a set of coexisting living beings with particular biological and pathological features and which falls under specific forms of knowledge and techniques' (Security, Territory, Population, p.367)

"what is striking in all four of the historical cases considered here is the sheer ineptitude of the military management of the biological and pathological features of the camps -- in other words, the _lack_ of 'sepcific knowledge and techniques'. In the Cuban, South African and Luzon cases, despite the absence of a genocidal intent on the part of the occupying forces, it was the indifference of the military to developing effective techniques of managing the population biologically that led to mass mortality."

"... while racial ideology was indeed central in this period, it emerged in an interaction between metropolis and colony, was highly changeable, and was frequently intsensified by the experience of war."

"the Filipinos' use fo guerilla warfare was seen by the Americans as marker of uncivilised status in contrast to the idea that the 'superior' races conducted formal warfare."

"although racial ideology was important in the era, it was not static but fluctuated in relation to the contingency of war."

"The decsions generals make are historically bound, and forms of rationality are culturally inflected. Caommands are issed not on the basis of an abstract rationality, but in the context of particular, historically contingent cultrial assumptions which are embedded in institutional strcutures and practice. What the ideology of military professionalism had done was to open up, at a particular historical point in time, the possibility of an instrumental logic of military success."


"The experiences of 1896-1907 placed the notion of the concentration camp into global circulation as a military 'solution'. The coverage of teh campes in the new print media provided powerful weapons to military leaderships in defending and respectabilising their existence."

New intercontinental communications systems such as the undersea telegraph cable enabled what P.K Datta describes as a simultaneity that did away with 'the fundamental distinction between teh orginative space of the event and the space of its social impact.'

"The 1899 Hague Conference was itself a milestone in the production of the 'media event'. It constituted the first international conference of states to be accompanied by a major flurry of activit by what we would today cal 'NGOs' and the international press."

"Socialists and anti-colonial nationalists did not reject the discourse of civilised (and thus, in the context of the time professionalised) warfare, but rather sought to redefine it in a way appropriate to their struggles."

Chinese radicals, including nationalist leader Sun Yat-Sen, looked to the Boers and the Filipino resistence as models of modern warfare. "The lessons that Asian nationalists chose to learn from the Boers were about the efficacy of anti-colonial guerilla war rather than about the humanitarian issues relating to the position of civilians in that new warfare."


"the wars in which the concentration camps arose were also media wars. And that brought the concept into the conscousness of the young future leaders of major authoritarian movements."
