"... Heidegger is right to affirm that his thinking reflects a critical moment, what he calls an _Umsturzsituation_, a 'revolutionary situation'. In his own way he never ceased to reflect on the profound crisis of which Germany was the focus; or rather, to be more precise, the crisis of Germany and the German university system never ceased to be reflected and expressed through him." p.7

"... there developed, at first on the margins of the university, an entirely distinctive _ideological mood_, which gradually impregnated the whole of the educated bourgeoisie." p.8

"This confused, synchretistic language is merely the pale, unfocused objectification of a collective _Stimmung_ [mood] whose spokesmen are themselves only echos. This _völkish_ [populist] mood is fundamentally a disposition towards the world which remains irreducible to all objectification in speech or in any other form of expression." p.9


>The 'conservative revolutionaries', whether they were bourgeois who were excluded by the nobility from the prestigious posts of State administration, or petty bourgeois who were frustrated in the aspirations aroused by their educational success, found a magical solution to their contradictory expectations in teh 'spiritual renaissance' and the 'German revolution'. 'The spiritual revolution' which was supposed to 'revitalize' the nation without revolutionizing its structure is what allowed these actual or potential _déclassés_ to reconcile their desire to maintain a priviledged position in the social order and to rebel against the order denying them this position, wth their histility to the bourgeoisie who excluded them and their repugnance for the socialist revolution that threatened all the values which helped to distinguish them from the proletariat.

>The stuctural ambiguity of a system of thought based on a dual refusal, whose logical outcome is the _self-destructive_ notion of a 'conservative revolution', is written into the generative structure which sustains it, that is, the desperate effort to overcome a set of insuperable alternatives through a kind of headlong flight, whether heroic or mystical ... p.29

>Jünger's bellicose aestheticism is basically inspired by a hatred of weakness and irresoluteness, of the self-destructive uncertainty of reasonable reason, and also of the gap between words and sensory, sensual reality.

Jünger joins Heidegger in a "virtual preference for risk and danger, which incites people to take up an extreme position where they appreciate freedom in the moment of its destruction, and assume their responsibilities by experiencing the elementary violence of the here and now"
