Hegel: there is not pure impression.

* Conditions of possibility: Kant
* Conditions of existence: Heidegger
-	what are the enabling conditions

Perception is not conceptual.

Husserl’s phenomenological method: detached reflection on your experience while you are observing something

Merleau-Ponty’s method: describe the world while you are coping with it

What is going on when you perceive? Phenomenology deals with what withdraws so that we can experience objects.

Heidegger’s angle: breakdown.

What experiences makes it possible for us to see stable objects.

Striving to get maximal grip on the things we perceive.

Constancy hypothesis: correlation between sense organs and experience.

Constancy phenomena.

Meditation is not the same as a phenomenology of being involved. Meditation is like a breakdown situation. Too subjective. Not illuminating about ordinary coping.

Mediating stories don’t work. We open our eyes and see stable objects with constant properties.

An experience of objectivity (predicate, properties) or subjectivity is on the basis of your general experience of object in the world.

Generative mechanisms. Phenomenology.

Merleau-Ponty: Your experience constantly needs to be stabilised. We are composing the text of the world.
