We can make a distinction between description and explanation.

## Description

Description is the our way of evoking experience, of bringing the reader into a space of recognition. The naturalised assumption here is that desciption is simple, but it is not. This way of thinking about description presumes an simple division between the describer and what is described. that it is never neutral.

Description is always situated, relational, and perspectival. Description cannot aim at completion.

Description always already occurs in language. The language of description always presumes a way of living, a form of emotioning and

Description in and of itself has effects. It draws our attention to things that we might otherwise pass over. The language of description gives us a handle on things. If there is no descriptive language there is no interobjectification.

Description can spark moments of recognition.

Because description occurs in language it always implies an emotioning.

Phenomenological description is a particular kind of description.

## Explanation

To explain something is answer the question of by what mechanism a particular experience is generated.



[Maturana and Verden-ZÃ¶ller: "we are neither our bodyhoods, nor our behavior, rather we are a continuous systemic dynamics that takes place in the interplay between bodyhood and behavior, and we exist as languageing beings in a relational space that arises in that dynamics" p.29]
