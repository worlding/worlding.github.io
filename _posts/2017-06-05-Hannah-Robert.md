## Classical Economics: Measuring 'value' amd re-defining property

Gideon Lang, a squater at Port Phillip:

>Waste Land produces nothing, it yields no article of exchangeable value, and is therefore worth nothing; before the settlement of New South Wales, the whole continent of New Holland produced nothing whatever and was therefore of no value to nation or individual. 64

>The knowledge produced by economic theorists enabled colonisers to assert themselves as a class capable of measuring value, whereas indigenous peoples were portrayed as blithely unaware (and, therefore, undeserving) of the potential economic riches beneath their feet. 65

>... colonisers expressed claims over land based on their ability to measure and value land hitherto unmeasured and unvalued by indigenous peoples. They juxtaposed this construction of indigenous land as useless with their own grandiose visions of 'usefulness' and abundant value.

>Wakefield construed indigenous peoples' lands as waste lands which were immediately available and which held only potential value if combined with European capital and labour. 67

>Rather than setting this notion of property-by-value in opposition to traditional common law principles of property-by-occupation, economic theories construed 'value' as the definitive logic of occupation.

>economic theories operated to lever apart the common law connection between traditional occupation of land and 'property'. claims which were recognised as 'property' woudl fall within the common law system of transfer, whereas lands distinguished as 'waste' required little or no compensation.

>Economic techniques for valuing land meant that colonisers could distinguish Aboriginal rights to land from the category of property rather than transferring those rights to themselves by treaty or conquest.

>In order to assert the authority of economic knowledge, theorists historicised economic concepts of value within the common law tradition of property through narratives of the initial creation of property.

>Where colonisers' accounts fo American First Nations were utilised as the specific evidence for Locke's and Rouseau's creation narratives, this evidence---already invested with colonising interests---was abstracted into theories through which all indigenous peoples encountered by colonisers could be characterised as 'savages'---sometimes ranked as hunter-gatherers, sometimes as pastoralists, and occasionally as agriculturalists---but always ranked lower than Europeans. 72

>Stadial theory intimately connected two tasks in the colonial interaction with indigenous peoples---recognition of rights in land and a proto-anthropological assessment of indigenous peoples.

>This mythology of scale of civilisation provided an ideological rationale for different treatment of different indigenous groups---yet local differences in colonial policy appeared to be determined more by pragmatic considerations, such as the military strength of a particular indigenous nation. 72

>Indigenous rights in land were acknowledged _within_ this model of natural rights but simultaneously _excluded_ from the category of private property. 73
