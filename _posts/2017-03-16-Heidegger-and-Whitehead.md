# Heidegger and Whitehead on Lived-Time and Causality
by Ron L. Cooper (1993)

* Heidegger offers a transcendental description of human existence.
* Whitehead interprets human experience as an instance of his causal theory of nature.

Cooper's claim:

in Whitehead's approach to the question, "How do we discover causal categories?" the causal features of his notion of human experience can be seen as transcendetnal structures of experience, that is, those features that render intelligible the possibility of any experience at all, and not as categories taken from a theory of causality and then imposed upon human experience."

"an understanding of Heidegger's method of excavating the primordial "existentialia" [the conditions without which our experiences cannot be understood as possible] of experience in _Being and Time_ equips us with an interpretative scheme by which we can discover a similar transcendental analysis operating in _Process and Reality_."

Whitehead shows that we come to an understanding of causality through the recognition of our own feeling of causality that is a structure of originative experience itself. It is this feelign of causality that supplies our sense of lived-time.

Both agree that epistemology is mistaken in taking self-reflectng, conscious events to be our most immediate experiences.

The phenomenon of experience is prior to theories of it.

Whitehead. Two modes of perception:
1. Presentation immediacy -- clear and distinct visual images of objects presently before us.
2. Causal efficacy -- primary, vague feelings of the weight of the past, of our primordial invovlement in the creative advance of process.

Presentational immediacy is derived from perceptions of causal efficacy.

Heidegger: "the intellectual separation of any object from its realtional context removes the "worldliness" of the object"

"An entire field of possible invovlements is intended in each act of experienceing an element of the world."


# Whitehead and Heidegger
by Raymond J. Devetterre, 1980

According to Heidegger the thinking that came to be known as metaphysics is defined by three essential characteristics that emerged during the Presocratic, Platonic and Aristotelian phases of its development:
1. The distinction between essence and existence
2. The distinciton between the reality and appearance
  a) the bifurcation of the sensible and the super-sensible
  b) the divinization of the supreme supersensible being into an absolute under whose aegis all otehr beings are subsumed in a unity
3. The domination of thought by logic built on the principle of sufficient reason
