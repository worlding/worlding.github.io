* "What is new taken as "liberal" opinion in the United State continues to be broadly supportive of the international human rights movement and seems to take for granted that nationalism is in some fundamental sense averse to liberalism." 294 Nationalism is seen as an inherent danger to liberalism.

## The law of Nations from Grotius to Vattel

* Grotius: the "essence of law as properly and strictly so called ... lies in [contractual] obligations to him" 297
* "Grotius traces the obligations of states to a process of "mutual consent" by which "certain laws ... orginate as between all states or a great many states," having "in view the advantage, not of particular states, but of the great society of states"
* Grotius attributes the authoery of that law to "the very nature of man, which even if we had no lack of anything woudl lead us into the mutal relations of society"
* The "source of law properly so called" is "maintenance of the social order", which is based on "an impelling desire for society, for the gratification of which [man] alone among animals possesses a special instrument, speech"
* The preemptive demands of peace require a specual status for states.
* Grotius declaims at great length agains the notion that people have any inherent right of resistance to unjust government.
* Argues against the notion that government is bound to rule in the interests of the governed.
* The consequence of Grotian reasoning is that rulers owe more respect to each other than they do to their own people.
* Peoples may be owned by rulers

* Vattel rejects "consent" as the touchstone of right. Instead, Vattel affirms a series of inalienable rights. 302
* There is a right to revolution justified in Lockean terms.
* A nation has a duty to defend itself.

## Nationality in Locke

* For Locke nations are necesssary vehicles for safeguarding individual rights and government by consent.
* The prevailing moral notions in each nation are more important than the laws imposed by its government.
* Each nation has its own language and its own moral code that is in effect codifited in the common way of speaking there.
* Democratic populism: each society is governed "chiefly" by the usages of the majority or of "the greatest part" --- not by the wisest or the best.
* The moral doctrine of the _Essay_ undermines the claim of the most educated in each nation---those, for example, who can readily discourse across national boundaries in Latin---to have a superior moral or political undertanding.
* Locke theorises a prepolitical or suprapolitical bond. Insists on the necessity "to destinguish between the dissolution of the society and the dissolution of the government"
* Locke assers that laws are the "bonds of society" and when the execution of laws "totally ceases, the government visibly ceases and the people become a confused multitude [Hobbes?] without order or connection."
* It is the fear of collapsing into a "confused multitude" that galvanizes revolutionary leadership. Emphasises not the popular desire to remain united but the people's need to guard against tyranny.
* The whole discussion of national liberation seems to rest on the assumption that property rights cannot be secure---at least not reliably secure---under a foreign government.
* Property rights underlie the territorial integrity of nations.
* Legislative authority may be forfeited not only when it violeates the basic rights of the members of society, but when it disregards the national identity of the society itself.
* "The reason why men enter into society is the preservation of their property."
* "like property, nationality builds on powerful, self-protective and acquisitive impluses: nationality in Locke's ccount is infally a possession"

* "National are, like property, defined by boundaries, ina literal as well as metaphorical sense."
* Tarcov: "Locke's concern for fences against the worst, rather than paths to the best or for a balnce of good and bad, is ... the fundamental principle of Locke's liberal politics."

## Lockean Legacies
* Nationality is of no great importance in the thought of Grotius, becuase natural rights are not decisive in his account of political obligation.
* For Locke, the national community---the community that can act politically or independently in the last resort---is the crucial predicate for the protection of individual rights
* How does the community become one people? Locke must evoke nationality and keep it as something contingent, almost accidental.
* It is not a political constitution that makes a nation, in Locke's account, but the prior existence of a nation that makes it possible to have a liberal constitution. A nation is a people willin got defend their independence in common.
* John Stuart Mill: "Free institutions are next to impssoble in a country made up of different nationalities"
