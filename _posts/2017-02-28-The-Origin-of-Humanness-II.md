# Systemic/Analogical versus Local/Causal Reasoning

>Reasoning is operating according to the coherences of language, and occurs according to the regularities of the flow of living together in consensual coordinations of consensual coordinations of behavior that language is.

The grasping of the coherences of livign and of the domain of existence in which we live has three basic forms. (The second two are abstractions of configurations within those coherences that we ue as two different forms of reasoning):
* awareness of the operational coherences that take place in the actual flow of the living of living systems as they operate as such.
* Systemic and analogical: using similarities in configurations of relations between different systems to claim systemic similarity.
* Linear causal reasoning: when we see recurrent configutrations of sequential relations and use them to claim causal relations. Constitutes the field of the constructive possibilities in wich scientific explanations and modern technologies could arise.

>Rationality has a circular character that keeps us enclosed in the coherences of our living, which is in fact the source of its operational effectiveness.

* Thinking is different from reasoning. It does not occur as a process in language.
* "Things or situations that appear to us as similar in different domains fo the biosphere or the cosmos are usually similar as a consequence of the historical systemic interconnectedness to which they belong."
* The fundamental difference between the two manners of reasoning rests on their different domains of effectiness. Systemic analogical reasoning grasps and reveals systemic coherences acorss non-interecting domains. Linear causal reasoning grasps and reveal local coherences within the domain in which it applies.
* The use of both forms of reasoning entails a "double look" that attends to both the locality of a process and the systemic context in which it occurs.
* A cultural reductionist orientation, through the search for control, has interfered with the understanding of systems.
* What we do is a matter of desire, of motives, not of reason.
