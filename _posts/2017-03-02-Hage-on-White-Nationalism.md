Centre of Multicultural Studies found that "certain cultural forms of White-ethnic power relations remained omnipresent in a multicultural society, and were reproduced by the very ideologies of cultural pluralism and tolerance that were supposed to transcent them."

Concern with a structural affinity between what is categorised as 'racist' and the discourse of the dominant culture.

Those who want 'ethnics' to stay or leave are divided as to who and what should be allowed into the national space.

They were united in feeling they were representative enactors of Law in Australia and that 'ethics' are people one can make decisions about.

[From where does this sense of entitlement emerge? How is it sustained? What are alternatives?

The entitlement is ontologically designed.]

Said: The reduction of the other into a passive object of government.

The naturalness of assuming one is entitled to direct the traffic.

>White racists and White multiculturalists share a conception of themselves as nationalists and of the nation as a space structured around a White culture, where Aboriginal people and non-White 'ethnics' are merely national objects to be moved or removed according to a White national will.

There are different ways of experiencing multiculturalism. "More Asian faces in the street", "more diversity in the neighbourhood restaurants"

When White people who embrace the White nation fantasy look at a migrant they differentiate between those who are Third World-looking and those who are not.

The fantasy aims at containing the active role of non-White people.

Whiteness is an aspiration rather than an essence.

Whiteness and Australianess are not governed by an either/or logic but a economy of accumulation. People are more or less White. Whiteness depends on social attributes.

Regarding Hanson: "one never knows with her where the ordinary concerned Australian ends and the neo-fascist party machine begins"

[This is such a strange statement. It is posed in an epistemological register rather than ontological one, that is, as a question of how one might discern a particualar distinction rather than a question of whether or not such a distinction or the terms in which it is presented make sense. In this respect Hage's question is based on the belief in the possible separateness of "concern" on the part of the "ordinary Australian" and fascism. My response here is to ask if there really is a sensible difference between the "ordinary concerned Australian" and fascism? Or to put this question in a different way, what are the actual consequences of this distinction? We need not collapse "ordinary concerned Australian" into "card carrying fascist", but this is not to say that there isn't something inherently fascist about "the concerns of ordinary Australians." We might ask how else one is able to become an "ordinary Australian" other than by buying into the terms of a White nationalism that is foundational to fascism. Before the fascist party the is the fascist concern. The fascist party amplifies and expands something that already exists. The fascist party is merely organised and articulated fascist concern. The more useful question here is not how to distinguish concern from fascism but to discern the fascist style concerns. The point here is not to say that everything is fascism but, rather, to understand fascist sentiments as something that circulates as a possibility for actualisation within settler-colonial society.]

If a sense of loss were detected earlier on and addressed, could it have found an expression that wasn't fascist?

White multicultrualists cannot admit to themselves that migrants and Aboriginal people are actually eroding the centrality of White people in Australia.

[The White multiculturalist is someone who still believes that the influence of the "Third World" is containable.]

White people who experience loss have no mainstream political language through which to express themselves.

[This too is bizarre. How does a fascist concern find mainstream expression without mainstreaming fascism? The problem is not the end of Whiteness but identification with it. This identification is not voluntaristic, it is ontologically designed.]
