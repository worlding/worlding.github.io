>controversies about entitlements to property incited Thomas Malthus and David Ricardo to frame concepts essential to the foundation of economics. ... Economics and property rights matured together, sharing their origins and maturation in particular chapters of English domestic and imperial history, including the Tudor breakup of church estates, the rationalization of landholdings by enclosures, and the acquisition and reallocation of lands in Ireland, North America, southern Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. 79

>The concept of improvement figured centrally among British-American practices respecting property, not as a legal doctrine but as an eminent rationalistic cultural ideal that conflicted with such principles of the common law as possession and quiet enjoyment. The idea led to alterations in the law and administrative practices because it worked on the political sensibilites of authorities who claimed sovereignty and enactted the positive laws that sustained property rights. 80

>a property right is a relationship between a person and other persons respecting access to resources ... "an enforceable claim to some use or benefit of something"

>Many possessors tried to exand them at little cost and insisted that they held more rights than the law recognized. To expand uses and benefits, they carried pretitions -- supported with the rhetoric of improvement -- to sovereign authorities. Arguments were almost unnecessary, because the authorities' cultural assumptions were steeped in ideas of improvement shared with other ascendant Europeans. This bias affected encounters between colonizers and indigenous peoples because, though the common-law doctrine of possession gave First Peoples interests in land, the notion of improvement undermined these interests.

>British and American settlement frontiers witnessed a conquest of space by private enterprise, pressing, in the name of improvement, against government rules.

>in new settings the English fascination with landed property mutated. The urge to hold land led to refinements in the instruments that defined and organized property rights. Customary conduct, statutes, case law, surveying practices, and government administrative practices were modified.

>By the mid-nineteenth century, democractic politics also permeated the land policy discussions in British settlement colonies, and populist campaigns to spread the wealth of land to all classes soon followed. 83

>The word "improvement" was as widely used as "democracy," though its meaning shifted with circumstances, serving colonizers' justifications for securing title from First Peoples, advancing the claims of aspirant farmers and speculators against pastoralists, and justifying the action sof some land seekers agains other who were branded mere speculators.

>The English aristocracy were early in their concentration on a variety of landed property issues. In England, what had emerged by the eighteenth century were understanding about property suited to a society thriving on commerce, governed by families with landed estates, and faboured with political stability. Other European systems of thought about land and rights did not contribute so massively to the foundations of a modern preoccuption wiht individual property rights. 83-4

>... early grazers in Australia and New Zealand ... at first accepted insecure tenure as the price of cheap pasturage. ... On British and American frontiers, the idea of improvement was aligned with notions of increasing the land's carrying capacity. Along with democracy, the goal of impeding idle landholding promoted small farmers in allocating resources.

>The small-holder allocations in the English-speaking world derived from populist politics in democracies, but also from a beleif that small parcels would ensure that land went to people who would improve it.

>The eighteenth-century [French] physiocrats' analysis of economic development stressed the exclusive productivity of the soil. Physiocracy abounded in observations about the need to encourage, even force, investment in agriculture, and these made it, in a few respects at least, as interesting as the contemporary laissez-faire analysis of Adam Smith and the practical guidence of "agrarian patriotism."

>Progress was allied with improvement, and arguments that appealed to promises of improvement were used to challenge custom.

>When there were land deals between First Peoples and governments, it triggered an evaluation of Native entitlements, a materialistic assessment applying the moral and political yardsticks of the British or American colonizers. When invoking their measurement standards, they asked: How much land did a particular indigenous people control? How fully? Could a map show what was used and what was waste? If First Peoples occupied the land in a political and military sense, how fully did they exploit the territory's potential? 86

>To gauge the scope and strength of Native occupation, governments implicitly calculated the costs and benefits of expansionary conflicts. Colonizing governments rated the military potential of indigenous peoples in terms of their numbers, political organization, and strategic importance. (87)

>To refine allocations, white squatters were themselves judged against a hierarchy of land uses, so it is not suprising to realize that colonizing governments classified First Peoples, making presumptions about their capacity to improve the land and conducting this appraisal in concert with assessments of the land itself.

>Instead of respecting diversity as evidence of skilflu use of available flora and fauna, colonizers, driven to multiply their introduced and domesticated plants and animals, scrutinized and graded imputed discrepances between indigenous usage and an expected climax of exploitation. 88

>... when indigenous peoples adapted, they remained subject to adverse and dishonest evaluations ... 88

>Property rights in land were not formed in a world of abstractions. Although the common law supplied principles for property rights, these sometimes inconvenienced people who sense opportunities or waste. 98
