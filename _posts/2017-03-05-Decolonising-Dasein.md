## Unsettling design theory

The philosophy of Martin Heidegger has been a seminal source of insight for design theorists. [1] Thinkers associated with ontological designing such as Winograd and Flores, Fry, Willis, Tonkinwise, Lopes, Stewart, along with post-phenomenological theorists of technology such as Don Idhe, Peter-Paul Verbeek, Petran Kokelkoren, and Albert Borgmann have in varied ways drawn an understanding from Heidegger's work of the complex nature of our relation to and within our situated worlds of design. In this respect the understanding derived from Heidegger's work has proven to be of significant value to design theory. The particular usefulness of Heidegger's work centres for the most part on his way of articulating the ordinary but essential equipmentality of human existence, that is, our way of existing within, through, and by means of dynamic and relational ensembles of design. Heidegger's philosophy allows for an understanding of design _qua_ design, that is, from a perspective of interest in design as a distinctive kind of practice, knowledge, and socio-political agent. In a context in which what is uniquely powerful about design struggles to find expression amidst scientistic conceptions of technical innovation and aesthetic philosophies that centre the interests of the fine-arts, Heidegger's investigations into the subtle complexity of ordinary experience has provided design theorists with a means of establishing a theoretical grip on the uncanny significance of the naturalised-artificiality of our wildly variant natures.

The value of these insights will be further elaborated below but for the purposes of this section they represent the set-up for a discussion of a different kind of problem, namely, what calls for rethinking in an attempt to move from a Heideggerian inflected conception of design towards an engagement with questions of (de)colonisation. The difficulty here resides in the relation between what strikes me as two distinct and competing political ontologies, namely, a commitment to the aims and values of decolonisation versus the increasingly well documented case of Heidegger's fascist political ontology. To pose the issue in a preliminary way, the question to confront is one of how to face, understand, and contend with a situation in which a way of thinking that has been experienced as a source of insight has a shadow cast upon it by its connection to both a detestable politics and a catastrophic event of colonial violence. [2]

Since the publication of Victor Farias' _Heidegger and Nazism_ in 1987 there has developed a large and still growing body of literature on the question of Heidegger's Nazism and its relation to his thought. Perspectives divide in various ways but the strongest lines of debate seem to be on the question of how committed Heidegger was to the National Socialist movement, as well as the extent to which it is either possible or legitimate to interpret and judge his philosophy in connection with his actions during the period of Nazi rule. I will not spend time on the details of Heidegger's involvement, nor will I engage in any effort to work over the various comments and silences from Heidegger himself or his defenders and sympathetic critics. It is enough for me to indicate that the scope and diversity of these responses has been usefully surveyed by Gregory Fried in his book _Heidegger's Polemos_ (2000). In Fried's terms these range from efforts at denial, to justification, condemnation, recuperation, and problematisation. In recent years the debate has been re-energised by the publication of the _Black Notebooks_, a collection of hitherto private notes from 1931-1941 that are significant for, as Peter Trawny has argued, shedding light on the material influence of Heidegger's anti-Semitism within several key themes of his philosophy, including his thinking on technology (Trawny 2014). While Trawny's argument limits the the initial appearance of anti-Semitism in Heidegger's philosophy to the period of the 1930s his depiction is contested by Tom Rockmore who insists that anyone who cares to look will find signs of anti-Semitism present throughout entirety of Heidegger's corpus. Bottom line, it strikes me that the most significant point to contend with here -- at least for any serious political thinker who comes into contact with Heideggerian thought -- is one made by Fried: what are we to do with the understanding that it was by no accident that Heidegger's thinking lead him to fascism. Simply put, there is no possibility of learning from Heidegger unless, at the very least, we become sensitive to perceiving what is dangerous in his thought.

To pull back from this discussion for a moment it is worth considering the following response: if Heidegger and his thought is so troublesome why contend with it at all? Posing such a question provides us with the opportunity to check the error of assuming that any particular thinker could be more important than the political task for which call upon them to assist. On this front it is useful to clarify that Heidegger need not be defended as the singular or necessary patron of the insights that have otherwise been derived from him. To put this another way, developing a sensitivity towards the ontological nature of design is not something that of necessity requires an engagement with Heidegger. In one respect the condition of our being equipmental beings is, as Cameron Tonkinwise has argued, a more or less tacit assumption in the work of any designer, professional or otherwise. Here there is a way of saying that all practices of design embody at some level an understanding of equipmental being that Heidegger and his readers have fashioned into a object of inquiry that is derivative of how we actually experience design and designing. Moreover, it is both important and possible to recognise that aspects of what Heidegger's philosophy makes available to theory is manifest in the writing of many thinkers, including those positioned either within or beyond the influence of Heidegger himself, the discipline of philosophy, and the traditions of Western or European thought. There are other paths towards the kind of learning that Heidegger makes possible, paths that, to be clear, are of value not for being comparable to Heidegger but for what they reveal about the nature of design itself.

It is possible to acknowledge all of this, however, and remain unsatisfied with idea of abandoning a critical engagement with Heidegger. The error of imagining that any theorist or philosophy is without issue is one thing, but the factor that I think presses the issue in a more compelling way is that so much of the design theory that I suggest is of value to the task of re-thinking design has already arrived via an engagement with Heidegger's thought. To put the issue as openly as I possibly can, I want to be able to acknowledge and explain why this work remains of value despite the faults of Heidegger. At the same time I want to acknowledging that the idea of decolonisation presses us to consider what possibilities for thinking have been covered over by the form disclosure that Heidegger enables. The issue here is not that reading Heidegger might lead us in some mechanistic fashion to adopt his politics but, rather, that a failure to articulate and think through the problems of his thought leaves us ill-equiped to theorise design from the actual place in which I/we am/are, that is, as theorists who are already influenced by a philosopher whose relationship to fascist thinking, whatever the complexity, is undeniable. Seeking insight from someone we consider "safer", however, only works to defer and cover over questions that are required of a decolonial politics. Searching for insight amongst a diversity of thinkers is imperative, but so is acknowledging the detestable truth of a tradition of thought that holds within it things remain are important to us. Eliding the issue  via recourse to other thinkers would amount to displacing the kind of confrontation that brings to light what is at stake in the politics of decolonisation, which is nothing if not a call to reassess our relation to traditions as they are handed down and taken up not only prior to critical thought but as a condition of its possibility. That said, in what follows part of what I hope to demonstrate is that alternative thinking and critical confrontation are not categorical opposites. Rather, it is by reading with those at the margins of thinking with and against Heidegger that we can come to see the possibility of an different possibility thinking/being/doing. Such thinking encourages us to hold on to what we find is of valuable in Heidegger but also leads us to face outwards from his thought and press into futures that run against the grain of his political ontology. The examples I work with in this case include Dorothy Leland's critical reading of Heidegger's account of the social, Tina Chanter's reading of the gendered norms of Heidegger's ontology, and Nelson Maldonado-Torres' perspective on the coloniality of being.

As final word before moving forward, it is worth emphasising the extent to which the problematic to be engaged here is far from new. The thinking to occur here occurs in the midst of work already done by many powerful and serious thinkers. Among them are Arendt and Levinas, whose relation to both Heidegger and the violence of German National Socialism was intimate. The scope of what we are looking to achieve here is not equal to the efforts of these thinkers even if the questions are in many respects similar. The reason for engaging this question again lies in the sense that I/we are obliged articulate a stance that takes heed of their thinking while also doing justice to the concrete particularity of my/our own time and place. This is to say that while there is a sense in which the kind of work to be done here is not new, it is also not possible to substitute it with work of any other thinker. The issue at hand is not one that can be put to rest simply because others have considered it because what is at stake in work of such thinking is not simply how we relate to Heidegger but how we relate to our selves and the world in which we encounter others to whom we are always already responsible. That we might feel called to take a stance on our existence in this way is of course an exemplar insight of Heideggerian thought. In this context it provides direction for facing the question of decolonising (and) the design (theory) that is most proximal and, as a consequence, most difficult.

## Heidegger and design

The question to be answered in this part concerns what design theorists have learned from Heidegger. This involves considering Heideggerian insights in a generous light so as to provide a sense for what design theorists have been able achieve through their engagement with his thought. The point raised above concerning alternative sources of similar insight holds true but is not the focus of what I am looking to establish for the moment.

To provide a sense of what needs to be explained here we can consider what I suggest are two of the most significant insights that design theorists have derived from Heidegger's work, namely _equipmentality_ and _relationality_. In brief terms, equipmentality relates to what Cameron Tonkinwise has talked about as our _bethingedness_, that is, the manner in which our habitual involvement with the products of design is elemental to understanding both who/what we are and the manner in which we go about creating and recreating the naturalised-artificial environs of possibility in which we live. Designerly knowledge implies a developed awareness of the fact that an essential component of humaning -- following Tim Ingold's claim that "human" is verb not a noun -- is to be have an involved relationship with things, a relationship that makes humaning itself possible in all of its diversity and difference. Equipmentality informs us that there is really only one thing that could be more monstrous than the uncanny coupling of thingliness and bios that "we" in fact are, namely, the denial of such interdependence at both a practical and theoretical level. To deprive humans of their things amounts to either a fundamental misunderstanding of how we work, or, in practice, a more or less violent act of depravation.

The relationality of design, meanwhile, concerns the relational holism of perception and experience. This insight informs us that designs are never encountered or taken up in atomised isolation. [3] Rather, the practical significance of a design is something composed in the flow of activity and a meshwork situational references. We encounter a combination of table and chair, for instance, as equipment for sitting at, either for work or some other activity, not as some brute assemblage of meaningless material. The ordinary meaning of a table might distort or break down in case in which it is damaged or somehow unsuitable to the situation at hand but it nevertheless sustains its meaning as a broken or unsuitable for with respect to whatever range of affordances we assume are appropriate for that specific context. An ugly, wobbly, or badly positioned table calls attention to itself as a problem in relation to whatever is expected of a table in the situation at hand. Even a table that has been thrown away, perhaps one that we find abandoned on a public footpath or uncovered at a tip, is still recognised and read for what it is on the basis of an existing totality of meaning. In the most extreme situation, say case in which a table has been physically deconstructed into parts and arranged such that it is no longer legible as a table, these parts are still encountered in terms of their possible affordances -- perhaps as scrap material for a construction project, as firewood, or even as something of no interest at all. The crucial point is that the concrete significance of the table or its component parts does not change in and of itself but, rather, in relation to the particular circumstances of the encounter. The meaning of any designed thing is therefore mutable or historical, a question of the particular role that a thing has been disposed to play in the context of what are, for the most part, mundane, everyday activities. The meaning at play here is practical and concrete, and so of material significance to structures and processes that operate beyond the scope of the meso-level domain of perception that constitutes our situation of interaction. Relationality also encompasses less tangible dimension of experience such as style, mood, or atmosphere that are absolutely essential to the sense of possibility inherent in whatever situation we find ourselves in. For someone who finds pleasure in the practice of repair and finds themselves in a receptive mood, for instance, an encounter with a broken table might trigger an affect curiosity and positive anticipation. The same person, however, could just as easily find themselves feeling alienated from the pleasure of manual work such that the very same table acts as a trigger for anger and frustration.

It is with these insights that design theory reveals how the agency of design lies in what it is able to make most familiar, available, obvious, and important to us, and that no matter how natural this may seem it is in every case a matter of ontological designing. In this capacity design is must be read as practice that provides direction and inertia to social forces. When this thought in relation to wider patterns and structures design can be seen as providing concrete determinations concerning the balance of destruction and creativity, violence and restoration, domination and respect, and the defutural and futural. This makes design something other than an idealist practice in the sense that most of its power lies in regulating the unreflective habits and impulses of daily life. Design in action is not a force that appeals to reason. Rather, it shapes the character of everyday significance and, as such, the direction of activity and processes. [4] The question to address here is how design theorists have been able to derive insights such as equipmentality and relationality from the work of Heidegger. The next step I take in this process will be to reconstruct the some of the arguments from Heidegger's thought, focusing mostly on his earlier and most influential work _Being and Time_ (1927). The purpose here is twofold: to explain the broader conceptual context for what design theorists have found useful in Heidegger's work while at the same time providing some of the ground work for examining later critiques.

# The Question of Being

Heidegger's project in its most general terms can be described as the recovery of the question of _being_ from within or beneath the "Western" philosophical tradition, or, more specifically, the tradition of metaphysics. [5][6] The concept of "being" in Heidegger can be difficult to come to grips with for as Anne-Marie Willis points out its meaning can easily confused for something like mystical type essence or some "supra-entity" such as Spirit or God. "Being", however, as distinct from individuated and plural "beings", is emphatically not an entity or essence, nor is it to be thought of as a substance, a process, or an event (Dreyfus 1991, p.xi). Rather, the definition for "being" given in _Being and Time_ is "that on the basis of which beings are already understood" (Heidegger 1962, pp.25-6). As the argument goes, the "that" upon which beings are understood is related not to something composed of principles or rules that can dug up and formally represented but, rather, the everyday know-how of embodied social practices. Our most fundamental way of making sense of things is grounded in what we do, in our activity, in our involvement with things. Hubert Dreyfus suggests that the significance of Heidegger's interest in "being" can be usefully described as an inquiry into the nature of our most concrete manner of intelligibility, a task that involves distinguishing between several different ways of being as they relate to and concern human being. The question that Heidegger asks of "being", therefore, relates to a story of our basic and practical way of relating to what shows up within the existence that matters to us.

The task that Heidegger sets himself in _Being and Time_ can be understood as effort to correct an error that he saw as fundamental and pervasive in both the philosophical tradition and in the way of thinking that dominated the modern world. This error was found in the assumption that the most coherent or rational way to talk about being is in terms of the substance ontology laid down by Aristotle. The relevant aspects of Aristotle's argument are worth laying out for it informs us not only of what Heidegger was attempting to address in work but also the metaphysical conceptions of classification, change, and identity that continue to have force today.

# Substance Ontology

Heidegger himself had great deal respect for Aristotle, particularly for the way in which Aristotle studied the phenomena of human action and conduct. Heidegger took issue, however, with Aristotle's approach to the question of being, or at least the manner in which the account given led to foreclosure on the question of being itself. The story can begin with those elements of Plato's conception of theory that carried over into Aristotle's metaphysics, something that was a problem both in itself and for the significant influence of Aristotle's metaphysics throughout the philosophical tradition. Plato is well known for promoting a mode of reflection that valorises detachment from the world as a method for producing knowledge about the world that certain and, therefore, of highest value. This approach assumes that the proper way to understand the things is not to take reality at face value but, rather, to discern the ideal Form that lies behind mere appearance of things. Sensual experience represents a suspect source of knowledge as its being is merely a corrupt derivative of an absolute ideal, something that could only properly grasped via a process of rational abstraction. The Forms are universally and eternally correct and the task of philosophy is to derive their proofs and from them construct the most rational solution to any problem. It is by no accident that Plato's way of thinking stands out as a classical precursor to modernist aesthetics and theories of design.

Plato favoured a rational-idealist methodology in which the Forms can be derived through the technique of thought experiment and abstract logical reasoning. For a Platonist the highest priority in determining the being of beings is to discern the most general and perfect Form, something that was achieved by turning away from the appearance of things rather than towards them. As a student of Plato, Aristotle was heavily influenced by these ideas but in the process of his own work he found reason diverge on a number of core doctrines. Aristotle was more open to the approach taken by Democritus' materialist school of thought--a contemporary and rival of the Platonic school--and took an interest in deriving something of a synthesis between the two positions, that is, a philosophy that told a story of the relationship between identity (form) and change (matter) without reducing the reality one to the other. The result was the doctrine of _hylomorphism_, an account of how form acts upon matter so as to produce beings that are intelligible in their being. [7] Aristotle identifies this composite of form and matter as _substance_ (οὐσία, ousia) and it is with this concept that Aristotle defines the meaning of being. Being or intelligibility obtains in the substance of beings as the interaction of form and matter rather as an abstract Form that is absolutely devoid of all matter.

It is with this understanding Aristotle differs from Plato on the additional question of whether classes of things (e.g. apples) have ontological priority (are more real or intelligible) over individual entities (this particular apple). Plato of course gave priority to Forms but in Aristotle's system whatever is common or essential to individual entities of a particular class is that which gives intelligibility to the class as such. The essential properties of members of the class "apple" thus inhere in every individual instance of an apple such that a particular apple is perceived in its "appleness" regardless of whatever accidental or non-essential properties is may have, such as being in a bowl or rolling across a table. For Aristotle individual entities are more "truly" substantial for it is within individual entities that the greatest number of properties inhere. Higher order classes such as "species" or "genera" are distinct for helping to define the essential properties of a thing but they are nevertheless still "secondary" substances insofar as they inhere in individuals. The individualness of an individual does not inhere in anything else and so is considered to be a case of "primary" substance. The significance of this distinction can understood if we consider that there is, in a sense, more information available in a particular thing, the chair that you might be sitting on for instance, than there is in the concept of an abstract class such as "chairs". Likewise there is more information available in the concept of "chairs" than there is in the higher order class of "furniture", more information in "furniture" than in "made things" and so on and so on as the degree of abstraction is increased.

# The ontological designing of metaphysics

Aristotle's substance ontology is significant not simply as a point of departure for understanding the question of being in Heidegger's philosophy but for reasons that are relevant to the question of the relation between design and (de)coloniality. While I have tried to give a coherent representation of the most basic features of the doctrine there is a enormous history of commentary -- some major pre-modern figures being Al-Farabi, Avicenna, Averroes, Maimonides, Aquinas, Scotus -- devoted to teasing out and resolving the various ambiguities or "glitches" that have discovered within the Aristotelian system. While the influence of Aristotle's thought throughout Greek, Arabic, and Latin speaking worlds waxed and waned across time and place, the impact of his substance ontology -- an work which is at its core devoted to developing the means by which to produce certain or indisputable knowledge of the world -- remains extensive both within and outside the discipline of philosophy. This history is a significant part of the history of systemitisation itself, something that is today expressed in many branches of science and research, including the various natural (e.g. physics, biology), social (politics, economics), and applied (medicine, engineering) sciences. The computer scientist John F. Sowa, for instance, has observed that

>Aristotle's method of defining new categories by genus and differentiae is fundamental to artificial intelligence, object-oriented systems, the semantic web, and every dictionary from the earliest days to the present. (Sowa 2001)

Sowa also points to quote from the rationalist philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz (1646-1716) that provides a sense for the enthusiasm with which the thinkers of the European Enlightenment took hold of and extended the reach of substance ontology:

>The art of ranking things in genera and species is of no small importance and very much assists our judgment as well as our memory. You know how much it matters in botany, not to mention animals and other substances, or again moral and notional entities as some call them. Order largely depends on it, and many good authors write in such a way that their whole account could be divided and subdivided according to a procedure related to genera and species. This helps one not merely to retain things, but also to find them. And those who have laid out all sorts of notions under certain headings or categories have done something very useful.

As Heidegger argued, in our modern times substance ontology has been established as the hegemonic mode of knowing and representing knowledge. It has become a habit of thought and discourse that takes on the sense of being the most natural, obvious, and intuitive way of interpreting the being of beings. As such it represents the effect of a particular form of ontological designing, that is, an outcome not of the way things actually "are" but of the kinds of embodied equipmental practices that make such thinking and its associated practices meaningful. Substance ontology shows up in everyday or "common sense" discussions that are oriented towards determining the nature of things as property bearing substances. For instance, to interpret the presence of a bird as an instance of a particular species in the context of a broader taxonomy of living beings, or to interpret the patterns of one's feelings and thoughts in view of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, is to think and act under the influence of an habitualised Aristotelian style metaphysics.

The ontological designing of metaphysics holds regardless of whether or not the interpretation is correct with respect to any particular system as the effect in question lies not in conforming to any particular system but in having naturalised the habit of interpreting and speaking about beings in terms of properties, classes, taxonomies, models, co-ordinates etc. The significance of the metaphysical interpretation of being is also besides the point of whether or not such varieties of systematised knowledge are found to be "useful" or not. What is really at stake here in terms understanding both design and (de)coloniality is the assumption that knowledge is most valid when it can be represented or derived on the basis of substance ontology. Part of the argument that Heidegger looks to make in _Being and Time_ is that substance ontology represents a severely limited way of interpreting the being of beings particularly insofar as it renders us blind to the reality of pre- or non-theoretical interpretations of being. By framing the question of being as a matter of propositional statements, as a question of what we might claim to have being or not, the project of substance ontology misses out on the fact that we are always already with an understanding of being of beings before the question of ontology is ever raised. Further, substance ontology encounters a problem in defining the essence of that which all other properties are supposed to inhere in, meaning that its claim to be able to derive certain knowledge about the world invariably shows up as being without absolute rational foundation. In foreclosing on this problem the history of metaphysical thinking forecloses on the manner in which systematised thinking finds its ground in inexplicable "doings" rather than explicable reasons. The common cause of Heidegger, ontological designing, and decoloniality is thus an interest in situational rather than metaphysical knowing,

Assumption Heidegger looked to clear away

1. Explicitness: the assumption that we know and act by applying principles that, if we are able to make clearer, would provide us with more control of our lives. "he [Heidegger] can only _point out_ the background practices and how they work to people who already share them--who as he would say, dwell in them. He cannot _spell out_ these practices in so definite and context-free a way that they could be communicationed to any rational being or represented in a computer" (Dreyfus 1991, p.4)
2. Mental representation
3. Theoretical holism. Assumes knowledge must be based on implicit beliefs and skill must be generated by tacit rules.
4. Detachment and Objectivity. Assumed to be the superior viewpoint on reality.
5. Methodological Individualism. The social context is the ultimate foundation for intelligibility.

Dasein is a relation that relates itself towards itself.

Heidegger's manner of concieving both the question itslef and a way towards answering it was influenced by the phenomenological method he had learned from his one time teacher Edmund Husserl.

The Being of beings is the understanding that which each of us has prior to and as a condition of any kind of abstract theoretical mode of thought. Abstract theoretical thinking is expressed in many different forms but one of they key sources of its influence is related to the substance-attribute ontology elaborated by Aristotle. In Heidegger's terms the Being of substance is characterised

The study of everyday intelligibility

What Heidegger sought to address was the manner in which the question of being or ontology had been framed in a way that inhibited the ability to think rigorously about the fact that the bulk of what we do and experience has little in common with the theoretical attitude.

Heidegger perceived the need for an inquiry into Being against the prevailing common sense that the question of intelligibility could be captured as a system of formal representation. The Being of beings in all cases had been reduced to a question

Phenomenology
Husserl: transcendental ontology
Heidegger: hermeneutic ontology

The existential meaning of Dasein is _care_.

While modern/colonial philosophy has tended to center the agency of reasoned thought, Heidegger is one of few thinkers to pay close attention to the fact that our most basic form of engagement with the world is occurs through

Thomas Wendt: "Design involves the enacting of theory through the body

## Postphenomenology

Post-phenomenology is an approach to the philosophy of technology that appropriates

Thomas Wendt observes five key differences marked out by post-phenomenology:

1. If there is an essence to technology it can only be known through its concrete instantiation in devices. Technology is not some kind of spirit that expresses itslef in devices; our understanding of technology is shaped by devices.
2. Whereas Heidegger took dams and machinery as his exemplar cases, post-phenomenology looks at more everyday instances of technology such as pens, speed bumps, and tables.
3. Critical acceptance of technology.
4. Mediation: equipment acts back on its user

Post-phenomenology reinforces the value of Heidegger's thought to designers but does not engage in the kind of questioning that provides insight into living in a colonial society.

## Confronting Heidegger, decolonising Dasein.

My interest here is in what implications of more marginal readers of Heidegger for what insights they make available for thinking politics of decolonisation. The precise nature of the interest concerns how designers might participate in a decolonial politics _qua_ designers, which is to say, as people who have a practiced discernment for the relational and direction giving nature of design. This interest does not leave the question of design untouched, for it implies further how the conception and practice of design might need to change.

## Fry

In his introduction to _R/U/A TV?_ acknowledges what he calls the "aberration" of Heidegger's Nazi attachements.

Heidegger has blood on his hands. Heiegger was a "flawed opponent" of the ideas and embodiment of modernity's "productivist metaphysic"

Fry extends Otto Pöggler's question concerning how one might come to terms with the fact that Heidegger was a fascist with the question of how to come to terms with the fact that to be Western is, in part, "to be the imposer of a 'will to power' and a destroyer of Others".

It is hard to understand what value lies in "coming to terms" with "being Western". While we cannot become other than what historical circumstances have determined is possible, this does not imply that only option available in this case is to come to terms with this identity, particularly what is within our power to change.

Fry reherses a version of the Levinasian critique:

>Nazism is always immanent in his thought, via notions of essential being that posit a superiority of the condition of Being over the knowing of metaphysics. Object/being is placed over mind/reason, which is to place being beyond the frame of the judgment of good and evil. (pp. 17-18)

Fry concludes: "he must be refused as the source of a theology or doxa. He is also replete with ideas to excavate, transform, recoil from and learn by."

[1] Heidegger himself rejected the label of "philosopher" in favour of "thinking." The meaning of such a distinction, however, requires an explanation that seem irrelevant to what I am trying to achieve here. Given that there really is no way to understand Heidegger's work other than as and via an engagement with what continues to be called philosophy for my purposes here I see no major issue with referring to Heidegger and his work as philosophical, particularly given that it provides for a sense of difference with respect to the interests and disposition of design theorists, granted of course that in reality such a difference is not categorically distinct.

[2] For classic accounts of the connection between European colonial exploits and the German National Socialist movement see Hannah Arendt's _The Origins of Totalitarianism_ and Aimé Césaire's _Discourse on Colonialism_. See also Nelson Maldonado-Torres' _Against War_.

[3] See also Maurice Merleau-Ponty's critique of the notion of 'sensation'  in introductory section of _Phenomenology of Perception_.

[4] In anticipation of thinking the relation between design and coloniality we can note a number of interrelated avenues for consideration:
1. That design has been essential to normalising and extending the colonial drive towards conquest and expansion.
2. That design has been essential to consolidating and maintaining sense of entitlement that sustains cultures of conquest.
3. That design has has been essential to sustaining a capitalist mode of production that is structurally reliant upon processes of expansion and exclusion.
4. That design plays a role in the construction of border ontologies or ways of experiencing the impact of coloniality as a struggle for coherence, peace, self-respect, and meaning in one's everyday life.
5. That design holds potential for normalising alternative a practices of repair and respect.

[5] The common practice is write "being" in the capitalised form "Being", as is done so throughout the Macquarie and Robinson translation of _Being and Time_. I have chosen to use the lower-case form so as to counter the tendency to interpret the word in mystical or metaphysical ways.

[6] The idea of "Western" philosophy, particularly as it implies a line connection from the Modern to the Classical via Medieval Christian thinkers, has been contested on the grounds of its ahistorical and partial reading of history (Dussel). As a case in point even the narrow conception of philosophy, that which takes the record of ancient Greek thought as its point of origin, generally fails to acknowledge and include the material contributions of thinkers of the Islamic world. The origins of concepts in Chinese, Indian and other non-European sources, including the work of African thinkers prior to what is recorded of the Ionian pre-Socratics, has also been marginalised and erased from within the dominant historical narrative. Additionally there is the problem of taking the idea of "the West" as a natural concept despite one if its key premises being the ability of imperial powers classify and regulate subalterned modes of thought and the story of their origins. While more could be said on this issue the point to acknowledged here is that there is no way of escaping the ideological import of the idea of "Western" philosophy. I use the term is here with caution as way to explain how Heidegger positioned himself in the history of thought. While I would argue that this is an important part of the story of Heidegger's thought I have no interest in diminishing the problem of the geopolitics of Heiegger's thought (Maldonado-Torres).
