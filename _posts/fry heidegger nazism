In his introduction to _R/U/A TV?_ acknowledges what he calls the "aberration" of Heidegger's Nazi attachements.

Heidegger has blood on his hands. Heiegger was a "flawed opponent" of the ideas and embodiment of modernity's "productivist metaphysic"

Fry extends Otto PÃ¶ggler's question concerning how one might come to terms with the fact that Heidegger was a fascist with the question of how to come to terms with the fact that to be Western is, in part, "to be the imposer of a 'will to power' and a destroyer of Others".

It is hard to understand what value lies in "coming to terms" with "being Western". While we cannot become other than what historical circumstances have determined is possible, this does not imply that only option available in this case is to come to terms with this identity, particularly what is within our power to change.

Fry reherses a version of the Levinasian critique:

>Nazism is always immanent in his thought, via notions of essential being that posit a superiority of the condition of Being over the knowing of metaphysics. Object/being is placed over mind/reason, which is to place being beyond the frame of the judgment of good and evil. (pp. 17-18)

Fry concludes: "he must be refused as the source of a theology or doxa. He is also replete with ideas to excavate, transform, recoil from and learn by."
