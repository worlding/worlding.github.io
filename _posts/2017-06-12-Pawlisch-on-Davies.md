[Pawlisch describes Davies' use of law as colonising mechanism but does not go into the same detail concerning the meaning of 'improvement' as does Wood.]

## Introduction

* Sixteenth and seventeenth centuries Ireland was reduced to English sovereignty.
* A consistent explansionist policy (1569-76) was first introduced under Elizabeth. Led by Sir Henry Sydney the was successful in "establishing a militant programme that eventually tied successive adminstrations to extending Enligh influence by forcible means into areas hitherto beond the reach of crown government." 3
* In 1594 Hugh O'Neill led a rebellion of the Gaelic population against the English rule in Ireland. The campagn was finally defeated at the battle of Kinsale in 1603. O'Neill was forced into an unconditional submission to the Lord Deputy Mountjoy at Mellifont.

* "Davies realized that military force in itself did not provide an adequate basis for the economic and social exploitation of the newly conquered kingdom." 4
* "To secure the long-recalcitrant country, Davies proposed the universal application of English law to the whole of Ireland ina way that would facilitate assimilation of the the Gaelic polity and reduce the influence of the Old Enlsih descendants of earlier Anglo-Norman settlments that preceded the sixteenth century." 4

* "... this book discusses the role played by English law as an agency of colonialism in Ireland by reviewing select cases taken from Davies' _Reports_"

* "the common law never operated alone in the pacification of Ireland. English sovereignty had behind it the ultimate saction of force, and the maintenance of an army in Ireland was indispensable in ruling the country as a conquered nation." 5
* The large forces necessary to subdue Tyrone's rebellion were cut back at the end of the Nine Years War. In 1603 some 9,000 troops remained. This was reduced in 1606 to a permanent establishment of 880 foot and 234 horse. THe Lord Deputy retained the right to levy a further 2,000 men without consultation with the English government. "the army's primary mission was to maintain internal security throughout the ecountr in samll garrisons -- most of them in Ulster wjocj had, after all, been the heartland of Gailic revolt during the last decade of the sixteenth century." 5

>Coercion could be used to intimidate or to subjugate the natives, but terror in itself did not give rise to co-operation between the native polity and the conqueror or establish the conditions necessary for the economic and soical development of the country. In other words, the pacification of Ireland required an instrument other than military force to bring about an orderly administration under the supervision of a central government in Dublin. 6

* This instrument proved to be the common law, "which along with other elements of English judicial machinery becaem the major tool of a practical colonialism in Ireland." 6

* Features of Irish colonialism: a 'native problem' and "a divided settler community of Old English descendeats of an earlier Norman conquest along with New Enlish settlers and administrators who established themselves in various settlements planted during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries."

* "Canny pointed ... to attitudinal currents in England and Europe arising from the complex of changes wrought by the REformation, the 'price revolution' and the Spanish conquest of New Spain." 8
* "According to Canny, these events conditioned European thinkers to form a new social perception, which displaced a static outlok on society in favour of an anthropological view of social development. Belief in an unchanging social order receded before an apprectiation of the world's peoples as ranging from the primitive savagery of the Amer-indians to the alleged civility and sophistication fo contemporary Europe. English thinkers adapted this viewpoint to the Irish situation and concluded that the native Irish, like the Amer-Indians, were anthropologically inferior beings at a lower stage of social evolution than the English." 8
* "In addition to patterns of colonial organization and finance, Irish native policy also served as prototype for English subjucation of native peoples elsewhere, particularly in the American colonies." 8

## History of European thought on conquest and native rights

* Largely a result of medieval expansion into the Levant and Baltic regions. 8
* Origins of this legal tradition coincide with an eleventh-century revival of Roman law 9
* Of particular interest "was the elaboration of conquest right as the paramount legal justification to validate titles to territories acquired by military force" 9
* There was agreement that "conquest of a territory in a just war yielded full sovereignty to the conquering power." 9
* Two approaches to defining indigenous property rights in non-Christian territories: 1) developed by Innocent IV in the thirteenth century "recognized the validity of governments and property rights of non-Christians regardless of religious or political considerations", 2) developed by Hostiensis in 13th century, "asserted that no legitimate _dominium_ could exist without ecclesiastical approbation. This meant that infidels and heretics lacked the capacity to exercise legitimate political control and ownership without approval of the papacy. 9
* "The paradigm most favoured by ambitious rulers and governments was, of course, the Hostiensis model, which proved so useful to expansionists in the sixteenth century." 9
* From the 11th - 16th centuries the expansion of European-Christian power "owed much to secular authorities acting on papal letters authorizing the secular arm to invade and conquer territories, onthe convienient pretext that eithe rht inhabitants or their rulers had somehow fallen foul of the Christian church and its civilizing role." 9

## Davies' application

>As propounded by Davies, the application of conquest right vested England with a public law title to Ireland. Based on the Elizabethan victory over Tyrone, Davies invoked the now familiar powers of conquest to justify the eradication of domestic Irish law as little more than a barbarous and lewd custom, with an eye to eliminating all competing claims to Irish dominion, foreign and Gaelic, that were contingent either upon the political authority accorded to Gaelic chieftains, or upon the papal donation of Ireland to Henry II in 1154. 9-10

* "Davies' main objective and most difficult problem was to reconstruct property rights in land, especially those held by customary Gaelic tenures derived from a political authority other than the crown." 10
* "To faciliate the transformation of such titles Davies relied on the juridical teaching that property in the abstract sense represented a legal right acquired from the sovereign that enforced it." i.e. the defeat of O'Neill justified the replacement of the Gaelic system of title with the English.

>Davies and the Irish judiciary had thus created a legal formula subsequently adapted by English jurists in their discussions of native property rights during the period of rapid colonial expansion in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. According to the tenets of this formula, all laws and customs repugnant to the laws of the conquering power, particularly of landholding and succession, were either destroyed or subject to modification. 11

* English common law "stressed the individual over the family or extended kin group in landownership or occupation."
* "Gaelic customary law vested property rights in the corporation of the extended kin group. In practice this meant that individual holdings of land in Gaelic districts were temporary and subject to periodic redistribution either by what contemporaries referred to as the custom if gavelkind or by a scheme of succession known as the custom of tanistry." 11

>In order to incorporate such alien forms of property and landholding into the new state system whose sovereignty had been justified by conquest right, the Irish judiciary simply invalidated both gravelkind and tanistry by resolution of all the Irish justices acting in conclave. This extraordinary  use of judge-made law became not only the instrument by which English lawyers sought to assimilate Gaelic tenures, but also contributed to the emergence of a doctrine of precedent in English jurisprudence. In practice, elimination of native custom by judicial fiat meant that prior possession might be respected, but unless accepted as lawful by the sovereign or the judiciary, Irish tenures had no validity against a superior common law title. In other words, legal sanction by the conquering power was necessary to validate or create rights over real property in Ireland. 12

>The significance of Davies' application of conquest right to Ireland and the consequent elimination by judicial fiat of those aspects of native customary law that were either barbarous, unreasonable, absurd or lewd can be seen in subsequent litigation justifying English claims to distant lands during the formative years of the empire. 12

* In 1694 Davies' argument was referenced in a case refered from Jamaica to the King's Bench. 13

* Davies' doctrine "provided continuity for a colonial jurisprudence and for a strategy of imperial control over conquered territories." 13
* "Sir William Blackstone incorporated the pinciples set forward by the Anonymous case of 1722 in his discussion of overseas plantations and colonies expanding the doctrine to cover territories acquired by cession as well as conquest." 13

* Davies' formula for Ireland: 'tp give laws to a conquered people is the principal mark of a perfect conquest' -- became the paradigm for British expansion elsewhere. 14
