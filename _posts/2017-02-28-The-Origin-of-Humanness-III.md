# Our Present

What constitutes our systemic identity as human beings?

## Mother/Child Relation

>The main aspects of living in loving humannes, in the system dynamics that makes and conserves that manner of living through our living, are love and play in the intimacy of the mother/child relation.

A child that grows in self-respect and respect for others, their individuality does not exist or arise in opposition to the social community to which they belong.

If adults crea the conditions under which a new personal identity is systemically conserved in a new generation, a cultural change takes place.

A cultural change happens when a new personal identity begins to be systemically conserved as a new manner of living in a new network of conversations that expands suddenly or progressively into a larger community.

## Patriarchy

Most human beings today live in a patriarchal culture of one kind or another.

A patriarchal culture consists in a manner of living centered on appropriation, domination and submission, mistrust and control, sexual and racial discrimination, and war.

In patriarchal culture human coexistence may have many different forms, but it is essentially political.

Relations are viewed mostly as instrumental for gaining superiority in a continuous power struggle, and are mostly lived as such.

Cultures arise, like species, in the conservation of some basic manner of living defined and realised in us as a closed network of conversation around which all else is open to change.
