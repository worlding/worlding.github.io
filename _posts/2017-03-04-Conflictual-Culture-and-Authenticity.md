* Guignon: it is a mistake to read Heidegger's ontology of Dasein as an account of individualism. Human being is always bound to an historical culture and exists as a process or activity of taking up and taking over what already has been made available within that culture. Authentic Dasein remembers this, inauthentic Dasein forgets.
* Guignon is of the "Berkeley school" that assimilates much of _Being and Time_ to Wittgenstein's _Philosophical Investigations_. According to the Berkeley school B&T portrays a human being embedded in networks of shared social practices in a way that undercuts individualistic and mentalistic conceptions of the self.
* Key to this interpretation is a distinction between conformity and conformism.
* Social norms define both in-order-tos that constitute the being of equipment and the for-the-sake-of-whiches that give equipment its significance. Social norms presuppose and "averageness" or commonality that is not the same as blind conformism. "In becoming enculturalted into the practices definitive of a social world, we become familiar with the average or common (prevailing) significance of things. I come to understand the significance of chairs within my social world by learning how to sit on them and by learning that chairs are normally used for sitting. In this sense, enculturation involves conformity to norms."
* This conformity to norms is distinct from conformism understood as a tendency to latch onto whatever falls into the "range of the faimiliar, the attainable, the respectable" (BT, 152)
* The difference between acting on the basis of a prior familiarity with the in-order-tos and for-the-sake-of-whiches made available by one's culture and absorbng oneself in a narrow range of these possibilities and closing oneself off from a deeper mode of self-understanding.
* "Heidegger's _das Man_ analysis presents the "with-wrold" of shared social practices as if it were free from deep social divisions. It floats free from systems of dominance and subordination and from an analysis that links the prevailing practices of a culture to such systems. As a result, the framework obscures the way in which groups can be differently situated within a given historical/cultural realm. It obscures also the ways in which differences in one's factical situation can complicate the task of authentic living."

Guignon on Authenticity and Psychotherapy
* We define who we are through our actions. Actions are not the expression of an inner core of being, actions are the coming-into-being or the self or person.
* Inauthentic life is characterized by absorption in the demands of the present. One's understanding gets determined by immidiate preoccupations, successes, failures etc.
* Authentic life involves a breakdown of complacent absorption in everydayness.
* One's personal life story is always rooted in the wider drama of a communal history. Authenticity is a richer participation in public the public context.
* Guignon: "We can be human agents only against the backdrop of ... a shared medium of intelligibility." This medium is not neutral. It transmits a sense of what is important that we inherit from our historical tradition. We become attuned to the shared quest for goods definitive of a community.

Conflictual Cultures, Oppressive Social Structures.
* On Guignon's view, the individualistic conflictual model is wrong, both as an interpretation of Heidegger and as an account of the fundamental nature of human reality.
* But the "we" model can have conflictual elements that Guignon and Heidegger tend to ignore.
* Historical cultures can have deeply divided "moral maps", even though only one or some of these maps prevail in dominant instituions and practices.
* >Historical cultures aren't "pure": through migration, conquest, and various forms of assimilation, different histories are mingled, and the resulting mixture is not always or even usually a homogenous blend. (p.117)
* Not all of the paradigmatic stories, bedrock loyalties or commitments are shared.
* The difficulty of leading a "coherent, integrated life" can be a question of the sense of reality being constructed by practices of dominant, assimilatig culture conflict with the sene of reality built into the practices of different backgrounds.
* The dynamic is the fragmentation of living within multiple and incompatible cultural worlds.
* Cultures are neither typically pure nor egalitarian; prevailing institutions, practices, and norms don't embody the communal indentificatons, moral maps, and so on of every social grouping equally.
* The is a weakness of the idea of a "shared medium of intelligibility."
* Involvement in public forms of life can be pernicious for marginalised people.
* Lostness or incoherence is often described in the narratives of immigrant and conquered populations. AnzaldÃºa uses "borderlands" as a metaphor for the condition of being caught between cultures. The borderland is both a barrier and a passageway between the Anglo and the Mexican. The struggle with identity is intrinsic to borderland existence.
* "Conflictual culture": culture in which there are divisions over what is important, possible, and permissible. Conflicting "moral maps of aspiration" (Guignon).
* The conflictual nature of culture does not entail that every member of the culture will experience the struggle for identity.
* Marxist class analysis requires giving Heidegger's account of _das Man_ a specific location in the social world.
* >Being involved in a common set of historical practices does not ental tha tthose practices involve us in the same way, with or within a common set of aspirations and assessments.
* The stories that sustain being a master are not the same as what sustains being a slave.
* [Leland is contesting the commonality in Guignon and Heidegger's account of sociality.]
* Choosing a hero provides an exampar for composing one's life story.

Authenticity in Situations of Oppression
* What is authenticity to a person experiencing oppression?
* Heidegger developed the ideal in terms of his own Dasein and historical situation, which according to Bourdieu stemmed from a "_volkisch_ mood" that affected the vision of the social world held by conservative German intellectuals at the time.
* It was the shallow, irresolute, uprooted qualities that Heidegger percieved as dominating the _Dasein_ of his present age--that motivated his account of authenticity. [We see here the conditions for the emergence of a more explicitly fascist politics]
* The question of how authenticity might work itself out as an ontic ideal for members of subordinate or oppressed social groups dislodges this framework.
* Not taking up and over the practices of an historical culture but a focus on the axes of domination and subordination that affect the constrution of social identities and social groups and the production and circulation of social meanings within that culture. No monolithic cultural totality--the dominion of _das Man_--but multiple and overlapping histories and practices. Competing moral maps, competing stories and interpretations. Repression, suppression and cultural hegemony dims or levels down possibilities.
* If authenticity is linked to a struggle over social meanings it can be seen as part of a political practice
* Black Nationalism e.g. is a resolve to combat "demoralizing disorders" created by racism.
* Mythic pasts function as repeatable possibilities that one wants to be loyal to.
* To the extent that the narratives and practices of Black Nationalism take hold they resituate black American _Dasein_ as heir to a traiditon capable of fostering pride, loyalty, and resolve rooted in the hope for futures more positive than the possibilities laid out by the dominant culture.
* In conflictual cultures, the cultural hegemon of dominant groups constructs social identities for oppressed groups that perpetuates their unequal status.
* The dominatn norms and practices that control "averageness" police alternative meanings through practices of deauthorization, suppression, surveillance, and appropriation.
* Competing sotries and interpretations passed down within the complex of intersecting histories belonging to a conflictual culture are unequally available.
* What is more relevant is the "unsettledness" or "not-at-homeness" that springs from social relations of inequality.
